<h2>Prefatory Words</h2>

<p>The journal of Alfred Bannerlee,
of Balzing (Kent), is at last to be published practically in full,
and without the alteration of any name. I say “at last,” but I
suppose there are some who would leap with joy if the
closely-written pages of the Oxford antiquarian and athlete were
utilized, like Carlyle’s first “French Revolution,” for building
a cheery fire. Lord Ludlow certainly is one.</p>

<p>It seems incredible, but Mr. Bannerlee has requested Ludlow
to write an introduction to the book. Perhaps Mr. Bannerlee
was pulling the baronial leg. Of all the party of poor
half-maddened people who emerged from Aidenn Vale after the
powerful doings recorded in this Journal, I can imagine none
less likely to perform this service for the diarist who clung
faithfully to the task of recording terrors in the midst of terror
and didn’t hesitate to display the baronial character at its
craftiest. Small wonder, I should think, that on the eve of
publication of what he himself admits is “an unbelievable and
utterly veracious narrative” Lord Ludlow sails for unknown
seas, and makes no secret of the fact that England’s loss is
permanent.</p>

<p>Now, since his Lordship promises never to come back, I
don’t see any reason why I shouldn’t publish his recent letter
to me, and thereby, perhaps, satisfy Mr. Bannerlee.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p class="dateline">“Brillig, Ambleside, Westmorland, <br>
  December 27, 1927.</p>

  <p class="salutation">My dear Markham:</p>

  <p>One can scarcely conjecture what maggot of audacity
  was in the brain of Alfred Bannerlee, Esq., when he
  forwarded me his diary with the request that I write a
  foreword to accompany it ‘to give the stamp of reality.’ When
  you perceive the light in which I am placed in this unbelievable
  and utterly veracious narrative, you will not need to
  reflect in order to understand why I decline to have
  anything to do with the document. In accordance with Mr.
  Bannerlee’s wish, I am sending the diary to you, ‘an obscure
  but ambitious author,’ and I do not suppose that you will
  object to having your name upon the title-page. The whole
  arrangement impresses me as asinine, but, after all, the
  manuscript is Mr. Bannerlee’s and he should be allowed
  full scope to play the fool with it.</p>

  <p>In fairness to the author, however, I must abate the
  indictment. I do no more than allude to what seem to me
  distinct virtues in this account. They will appeal to others
  likewise, if they are virtues. In the first place, there is
  nothing of that grisly, putrid stuff going nowadays under
  the name of modern psychology, although a pedlar of this
  ‘science’ could have found no end of matter for his hole
  and corner methods. Second point: I am not a devotee of
  the enormous literature dealing with the hounding and
  capture of wrongdoers. But I will venture a pronouncement in
  my egregious innocence, to wit, that not in any half-dozen
  combined of these would-be ‘shockers’ published in a
  lifetime will be found as many trials and alarums and as much
  genuine mystification as make up this compendium of the
  bedevilment of Parson Lolly, the mad behaviour of the
  milkman, the invisible omnipresence of Sir Brooke Mortimer,
  the enigma of the mystic bone, the Legend of Sir Pharamond’s
  imperishable arm, and the machinations of the ultimate
  contriver, I will not call him ‘fiend,’ working through and
  behind all.</p>

  <p>And here it is my wish to express my wholehearted esteem
  for (then) Miss Paula Lebetwood. I dislike the whole
  species of American girls, but intelligence compels exceptions
  to every rule. Some of us judged her harshly, no doubt,
  but she took the road leading to success, and if she seemed
  cold-hearted, she chose wisely. Had she been a weaker woman,
  snuffling and inept, the narrative would not now be on the
  verge of publication. In spite of this, wherever she is, I wish
  her well.</p>

  <p>I myself shall not remain in England to witness the
  effervescence of the multitude over this narrative. Democratic
  outbursts rather gall me. On the eve of the publication of
  the Journal, my yacht, with me on board, sails for waters
  unknown. I seek as far as I may a shoreless cruise. I am
  old, and mankind is not my hobby. Perhaps I shall linger
  in the beauty of the Mediterranean where there are two
  skies, perhaps drift endlessly in the steady strength of the
  Trades, perhaps dare the dark Antarctic seas—or find beyond
  the sunset. One thing stands sure; it is unthinkable that I
  shall ever set foot in Britain again. So here I take farewell
  of those who with me shared the dread, wonder and aftermath
  of <i>Death in the Dusk</i>. (By the way, I don’t like that
  title of Bannerlee’s.)</p>

  <p>Pray accept my congratulations on your recent
  appointment, and believe me your sincere friend, and</p>

  <p class="valediction">Faithfully yours,</p>
  <p class="signature">Ludlow.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It is well, I believe, to point out that the minds of all those
present at Highglen House among the sorcerous hills of Wales
during the early autumn of 1925, the mind which directed
the writing of this Journal was, save perhaps one, the best
fitted for presenting the closest account possible to the truth.
The one other mind which could possibly equal this record in
truthfulness would be that which actually contrived the series
of demoniacal events in the Vale of Aidenn Water. The queer,
tense, potentially tragic, and ultimately fatal situation
discovered by Mr. Bannerlee after his serio-comic descent from
the Forest through the fog contained so many cross-currents
and tangled nets of misunderstanding, prejudice and enmity
that no other could have pretended to the shadow of fairness
in his (or her) statement of the case. For the sake of truth,
then (though God knows what disadvantages offset that!), it
was well that Mr. Bannerlee was plunged into the seething
midst of the Bidding Feast.</p>

<p>I shall not dilate upon the morbid eagerness with which
the public will seize upon this Journal. This is no hackneyed
chronicle of raw head and bloody bones. The consternation
caused by the events in Aidenn Vale, constituting, upon their
emergence after the flood, a problem of what may genuinely
be called universal interest, will never be forgotten by those
old enough to realize their dreadfulness. The nine days’ terror
became a nine days’ wonder, and without hyperbole it may be
said that the fate of one nation hung upon the Radnorshire
riddles. The public has never been informed of all there was to
be told, nor, as sporadic (and totally erroneous) statements
and versions in the press signify, has the public lost its
interest. Here, for the first time, is offered for general perusal
this unbelievable and utterly veracious document. Need I
comment further?</p>

<p>This is not, of course, the original form of Mr. Bannerlee’s
diary. What he wrote until the turmoil of events forced him
to stay his hand on the evening of the 9th of October was
necessarily briefer, more compact, and—to a reader not in touch
with the circumstances—unintelligible. His recasting of the
manuscript, which involved its enlargement to thrice its original
length is, it seems to me, one of the most notable of his feats.
Hard it must have been for him to alter this account from
the sketch-book manner of an ordinary diary, to give the
convincing gloss of rumination and reflection, to reveal precise
details of fact, the links of cogitation, and the phases of
feeling which poured in upon him. I think, too, that he has well
preserved the sense of imminence, the uncertainty as to the
morrow, which was, I am told, present in the original version.
If portions of the work seem lacking in spontaneity, let me
remind the reader that it was impossible for Mr. Bannerlee
to limit himself to a mere polychronicon of episodes, frilled
with running comment on persons, and edged with a neat
pattern of emotions. Clearness demanded he should sometimes <em>elucidate</em>
and the white heat of events must have time to cool
before they can be handled analytically.</p>

<p>Only last month I myself visited New Aidenn again. A
word of self-introduction to Superintendent Salt made that
rather wonderful policeman my good friend at once, and he
personally conducted me through the Vale where death and
terror had danced. It is all as Bannerlee describes it; even the
atmosphere of mystery has not departed, and while Salt and
I came down by Aidenn Water through the dusk, I was glad
to have him there, glad and nevertheless uneasy. The villagers
and the folk of the countryside know well that Parson Lolly
is not dead yet, though his age is nearer five hundred than four
hundred years, and often they see his black cloak whisk through
some twilight copse, or see him far off above the hills, poised
against the sunset.</p>

<p>Some day I shall write my own book about Salt: that other
mystery of East Wales, the frightful affair of the Straight
Road. But enough.</p>

<h2>I. <br> The Obtrusion of Parson Lolly</h2>

<p class="diarydate">Highglen House, Aidenn Vale, Radnorshire, <br>
October 3, 1925. 12.30 <span class="meridienne">A.M.</span></p>

<p>Heaven smile on us if it can! Heaven watch and
ward us. This is a wedding party!</p>

<p>Crofts Pendleton has just brought me the fresh candles and
this writing-book. He wished me God-speed in my endeavours
and good-night.</p>

<p>“Good-night!” It sounded like a travesty, or a challenge.</p>

<p>Surely I am the sane one here if anyone is. Yet I cannot name
the curse that lies on my spirit and keeps in my eyes the vision
of the two faces, the golden hair above the black!
Never-to-be-forgotten moment! But I shall not let it unnerve me now, as
it seemed to then.</p>

<p>The worst of it is that I am confined in a musty chamber
(among store-rooms!) on the second floor where the
web-scribbled ceiling slants down with the roof and the eaves
murmur uncannily just above my window—a room to make
flesh thrill and creep. It looks like a chamber where murderers
may have lurked in bygone days. The narrow, deep-set window,
the old twisty candle-brackets high on the stone wall, the joined
chest with never a nail to fasten its boards, the severely plain
four-square bedstead—they all remind me that I am in a
building centuries old where any or every fiendish deed may have
been performed. I wish that this storey, like the rest of the house,
were equipped with a good up-to-date electric service. The
blinking light of candles is not very comfortable in the gloom.</p>

<p>Nearly a page written, yet nothing pertinent said. This isn’t
economy in words. But now I’ll banish megrims, cease
rambling, and come to the situation.</p>

<p>I have been in Highglen House for a scant six hours. Events
have been moving with intermittent swiftness ever since I came,
and they had not been precisely quiet before my arrival.
To-night, though it takes until dawn, I shall describe as far as I
can the happenings of the last day unless I drift off to sleep
in the process. But no, even with doors locked, sleep is not
likely to trouble anyone much to-night, not after the alarm all
of us—I don’t except myself in this case—have just had.</p>

<p>Moreover, until the nowhere-to-be-found Sir Brooke puts
in an appearance, or some word is heard from him, there will
be little rest for me, with Eve Bartholomew knocking at the
door every fifteen minutes, with, “I’m so sorry, Mr. Bannerlee;
are you still up? It’s <em>so</em> silly of me, of course—Sir Brooke can
take care of himself as well as any of us—better, I’m sure, than
most—and yet I’m not so sure—but it’s really odd, isn’t it?
Now I know it’s silly of me—but I’ve just had another idea.
Don’t you think it’s possible that Sir Brooke took the wrong
train? Of course I don’t know whether you can do that in
Shrewsbury in the afternoon—but perhaps he got on the wrong
platform, or something—he never was an expert on getting
about, poor dear—and then he may have gone to sleep and not
noticed where he was going. He has a way of doing that in
trains—I know him so well, you see. Perhaps he didn’t learn
until he got off at some scrubby little place where there’s no
telegraph. And then, of course, that explains why there’s been
no message from him.”</p>

<p>I have learned a good deal about Sir Brooke’s character since
Mrs. B. began her raids with a Macbethean knocking and a
stage whisper. His chief trait seems to be utter fickleness of
memory, his next that something, or lack of something, which
makes able-bodied women like Mrs. B. call men “dear” with
“poor” prefixed. He is near-sighted, liable to vertigo
philanthropic, and a nuisance.</p>

<p>I said Macbethean knocking—I suppose that proves I’m a
little highly-strung myself. Certainly she caused a warm,
douche-like sensation to pass clear over my scalp to the nape of
my neck. We have had an evening which would make the
staidest—</p>

<p>I have a severe mind to draw a line through these pages and
begin anew. This isn’t what I intended at all. My candles
are bearded now, and I haven’t scratched my subject. I repent
and reform this very instant. I am going to try to put down
things in order, as they have unfolded themselves in the course
of one of the most amazing days I, or any human being, ever
lived through.</p>

<p>Yet first (before taking my way back to the hilltop where
I wandered this afternoon, never having so much as heard of
Highglen House!) while the spirit is urgent and the clutch
of sense is keen, I’ll transcribe the maddening events of the
half-hour just past. Before I forget—but shall I ever forget?</p>

<p>There they were in the Hall of the Moth, civilizees of
assorted temperaments, ignoring their alarms, submerging their
differences, and levelling their intellects in the fascination of a
card game. How “instructive and amusing” had been my
introduction by Pendleton to each of them in this very Hall
scarcely more than an hour before! Save for Alberta, that luscious
wife of his, I had never laid eyes on one of them previous
to this evening.</p>

<p>Straight on my entering the Hall, Pendleton had cavalierly
handed me around from person to person.</p>

<p>First he revealed me to his wife, who set down her cards and
rose with one of the gladdest smiles I have ever seen. She was
tall and gracious. Her face, surrounded by its lustre of
close-clipped, wavy hair, was a joy to look at, being both pearly-clear
and firm, like an exquisite lily-petal of classic marble.</p>

<p>“Alfred! We hear that you have been raiding Aidenn Forest.”</p>

<p>“Please!” I laughed. “I wouldn’t call it anything so forcible
as—”</p>

<p>But already Pendleton had presented me to Mrs. Belvoir.
I withdrew my hand from its clasp of Alberta’s and took the
cold fingers of the colourless man’s wife. What thoughts lay
behind those brooding lids and that close-lipped mouth? Her
face had a wavering indistinctness, like a face seen under flowing
water.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” she said in that rich voice, gave me one
full look with eyes cold and pale as sapphires, and blinked
languidly, as if the discussion were closed.</p>

<p>Pendleton did not let me linger in perplexity. He gave me up
to Belvoir, who shook hands with a faint smile, saying, “Mr.
Bannerlee and I spelled our names to each other in the hall a
little while ago.”</p>

<p>Next was Lord Ludlow. “I’ve seen him,” remarked his Lordship,
gazing at me with a little asperity, crinkling the skin over
the high-pitched bridge of his nose, and sat down, for he was
wishful of continuing the game, or of giving the impression that
such was his desire.</p>

<p>I was whisked to the second table and made acquainted with
the sole woman there. Eve Bartholomew (God give her peace!)
grasped my hand for a tug or two, exclaiming hurriedly, “Oh,
how do you do?” And she added, with ill-feigned casualness,
“They say you’ve been out on the hills to-day. You’re sure
you haven’t seen Sir Brooke?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure, Mrs. Bartholomew.”</p>

<p>“Or hear of anyone who might be him—he?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Next I was set face-to-face with her partner, the red-faced
young man, who I was not surprised to learn was Sean Cosgrove.
His head was large, his features large, too, without being
lubberly. The ruddiness of his complexion was accentuated by
his very black and shining hair, short and thick. There was
something grim and settled in the line of his jaw, and his blazing
black eyes bore out the character of determination. He shook
hands unsmiling, gravely.</p>

<p>“My congratulations,” I offered.</p>

<p>He gave a short bow, looking at the floor. Then, “I have
heard of you,” he said, with not a trace of Irish lilt or accent
in his speech.</p>

<p>“Is it possible?”</p>

<p>“You are a searcher for the buried lore of antiquity. Is not
that so?” he asked with a certain lofty seriousness.</p>

<p>“I have done a little research among the British saints, but I
hardly expected my labours—”</p>

<p>“They honour you,” asserted Cosgrove, but my smile of
deprecation and anything further he was about to say were cut off
by Pendleton, who relentlessly kept me on the go, and I faced
the next guest.</p>

<p>Two men had been partners at this table; I now found myself
staring at a waxed moustache, and a very elegantly tapered and
needle-pointed specimen of craftsmanship it was. The rest
of his face was nothing remarkable, only a little swarthy-purplish
with brandy, and a trifle stary-eyed. I was not prepossessed
with this gentleman, judging him to be the sort who
shows his cleverness to an assorted public in quips to
barmaids and dance-hall musicians. His name, “Mr. Charlton
Oxford,” struck me as strainedly aristocratic, though no fault
of his.</p>

<p>“Chawmed.”</p>

<p>“Aesthete,” flashed through my brain, but a query-note raised
itself after the word. “Just plain fool,” I concluded.</p>

<p>“You <em>are</em> being bandied about, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>I was surprised by the fluence and ease of his voice, and his
lightening smile, the big darkish man’s who had been dealing
the cards so ritualistically a few minutes before. He lifted his
weight as if it were that of a bubble, and I saw that indeed he
was big, bearing his torso on stanchion-legs. His mass must have
been twice mine.</p>

<p>“Gilbert Maryvale, our complete man of business—iron-castings,”
said Pendleton, with evident gladness that his tale
was over.</p>

<p>I saw a quick brightness come and go in Gilbert Maryvale’s
eyes at that description, as if the eyeball had darted out a little
from its station under thatch-brows.</p>

<p>“The winner of the Newman Prize for Lucid Prose, I think,
in—let me see—Nineteen-nineteen? May I congratulate you,
Mr. Bannerlee, although the time is past? I have read your
‘Poets of Enervation’ with delight.”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Maryvale, that was not my essay.”</p>

<p>“Surely I haven’t mistaken the name?”</p>

<p>“You have mistaken only the man. ‘Poets of Enervation’
was the overflow of my cousin Norval’s pen. We were in the
University together. I made a bid for the Newman myself, but
was buried. Norval and I are often mistaken for each other, even
in our literary occupations.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you ran him close,” observed the big man
twinkingly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not. And now, as Mr. Cosgrove has said, I am
devoted to dustier things, and the prose I give my time to is far
from lucid.”</p>

<p>“But you wring lucidity out of it.”</p>

<p>Maryvale resumed his seat, picked up his hand, as did the
rest, for in spite of much invitation I insisted on remaining aloof
from the game. Broad capable cheek-bones, sudden forceful chin
he had, but I had an awareness there was much more than
capability and force in this “complete man of business.” That
allusion to the Prize Essay for Lucid Prose was a poser. Was
there another trafficker in iron-castings in the United Kingdom
who had read “Poets of Enervation”?—or one who would speak
of it kindly if he had?</p>

<p>Well, all this was past, half-forgotten in ensuing talk. But
now, at one minute to midnight, a new presence was in the Hall,
threatening the mirth of the Feast! Anger!</p>

<p>For Lord Ludlow and Sean Cosgrove were having a beautiful
row.</p>

<p>The Irishman’s gaze was hard and heavy, and seemed to bore
into his antagonist. His face, I noticed, was still suffusing with
blood. No one else ventured to intervene as madly as I had just
done, and the silence when the two men ceased parleying was
like the yawn of ocean after a gigantic wave.</p>

<p>Cosgrove’s bitterness seemed to be growing steadily, like the
awful momentum of a railway train, and I had no doubt that
the time was not many seconds away when he would arise and
beard his foe with menacing hands. Lord Ludlow’s acerbity
was like the nervous, sputtering viciousness of a dynamo. From
his eyes seemed to come green electric sparks, while he shifted
his ire from me toward Cosgrove again.</p>

<p>“As for you, sir—”</p>

<p>“I accuse you—”</p>

<p>Hark!</p>

<p>The great Hall of the Moth where we stood was gripped in
a new hush, for the clock in the corner was speaking. I had
regarded it curiously in the evening, a fine old carcase with hood,
waist, and base enveloped in spider’s web marqueterie which
obliterated the graining of the wood. The brass dial was finely
engraved, and Cupid’s head appeared four times delicately
chiselled in the spandrils.</p>

<p>Now its chime gave the burden it has tolled for two hundred
years, and midnight was ringing sternly through the House from
the Hall of the Moth. It is a strange clock, devised by some
brooding or twisted or philosophic mind long ago: it strikes,
they say, only at midnight, proclaiming the death and the birth
of a day. The tones, vigorous and vibrant, were mellow with
centuries, and their song was poignant.</p>

<p>Like some greybeard councillor’s, the old clock’s voice appeared
to abash the hasty peer and the slowly enraged Irishman.
They stared at each other in grimness for an interim of seconds
before his Lordship shrugged his shoulders, cackled “Humph!”
loudly, and turned to the disrupted card-table. Cosgrove’s
clenched hands came down in his lap relaxed, and he, too, turned
back to his table, moving his lips without utterance.</p>

<p>But the game did not go on. It could hardly have pursued
its placid course again after this very distressing interruption
of our peace, even if the crying sound had not begun from
somewhere outside the Hall.</p>

<p>A low, tremulous, wheedling cry, strangled sometimes into
a moan—it froze every face and turned every eye to stone.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” gulped Eve Bartholomew. . . .</p>

<p>“<em>Where</em> is it?” asked Belvoir, and one could tell that the
“stick of dynamite” had not much breath to spare.</p>

<p>But no one seemed to have the breath or the brain to answer
him. My own belief for a moment was that it proceeded from a
plane above our heads, instead of from somewhere in the long
portrait-lined passage outside the Hall of the Moth. This seemed
to be Pendleton’s notion, too, for with a tense “upstairs!” our
host moved to the nearest door to the corridor. But Alberta
Pendleton, dismayed (like all of us, no doubt) by the thought
of the hovering menace that had shadowed Highglen House,
hurried across to her husband and clung to him, positively clung
to him, as I have seen actresses do in plays.</p>

<p>“No, Crofts dear—no, no! Wait—let someone go with you!”</p>

<p>“It’s up there,” declared Pendleton with steel-trap
enunciation. “The damned thing’s come again—up there.”</p>

<p>“That’s why you mustn’t go.”</p>

<p>“It’s up there,” he said doggedly, and tugged to loose himself.
But she took step for step with him, finally turning in his
path with her back against the door.</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” said Maryvale.</p>

<p>“All the men,” said Cosgrove. “The women lock the doors
behind us.”</p>

<p>“Ring for the servants,” said someone shakenly, I think
Charlton Oxford.</p>

<p>“Listen! . . . It’s not there any more. . . . It’s stopped.”
We listened with Mrs. Bartholomew; beyond our taut breathings
and the tick-tack-tock of the carcase in the corner—nothing.</p>

<p>“Ring for the servants, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Listen! It’s out there.”</p>

<p>“Out there!”</p>

<p>“On the lawn.”</p>

<p>Unmistakably now the low wordless cry came through the
half-opened french window leading to the broad lawns beyond
the entrance drive. Pendleton was across the room in a trice,
heedless of Alberta’s protest; so were Maryvale and Cosgrove
and I; so were all of us. We followed our host through the
window-entrance. Out to the darkness we went from the bright-lit
hall in a little throng, and when we were outside, hearing the
lonesome, half-whining cry no more, we recoiled and huddled
a little, like scared titmice.</p>

<p>Hardly a quarter of a minute—prolonged by our bewilderment
and dread—could have gone by, and we stood irresolute
upon the fringe of the lawn, when the cry came toward us again,
and now it was followed by a woman’s voice, different from the
cry:</p>

<p>“Oh, come here, come here! I couldn’t call you and leave
her alone.”</p>

<p>At the sound of that voice Cosgrove stamped like a raving
beast. “Paula,” he bellowed, and plunged across the obscurity of
the lawn.</p>

<p>Following among those whose urgence was less than his, my
eyes, which deviated from straight ahead, caught sight of a
spine-stirring thing. It was motion, but of what? A darker mass on
the dark sward. Size, shape, untellable—but moving, moving
to the right, now seeming to crawl, now leaping—only an
amorphous blob of black—moving, and swiftly, toward the
north, moving stilly, with only a small rustling sound at whiles.</p>

<p>“Look there!” I exclaimed to someone who was near me,
catching his arm. (It was Oxford.)</p>

<p>“Hey! What!”</p>

<p>“That—going off there—a black thing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it.” Nor did he want to, I judged.</p>

<p>I guided his arm, extending it in the proper line. “Sight by
that.”</p>

<p>But I could not make him see it. He and I then diverged
from the others, not much to his liking, and while we hastened
after the nameless thing, I bethought me that I had changed
my electric torch to these clothes. I hauled it from a side pocket,
darted a cone of yellow ahead of us, cast an elliptic figure of
yellow on the grass, but found no trace of the thing.</p>

<p>Oxford, however, saw an object ahead which made him give
a yell. He stopped petrified, and I followed his look far before
us. What we both then saw was too distant to be the thing I
had observed nearby, unless it were indeed a fiend possessed of
superhuman powers. He was crossing a patch of ground a
hundred yards away where the moon streamed down unscathed by
clouds; save for the quick, brief clearing, indeed, we should not
have caught sight of him. Like the hopping, gliding thing on the
lawn, he was black, or robed in black. Contrary to report, however,
if this were Parson Lolly, his figure appeared not to be tall
but distinctly short and squatty. Just then the fringe of a cloud
partly obfuscated the moon, but still that space was clearer
than all around it. While the figure glided toward the trees, it
seemed to heave its shoulders and grow a foot, two feet, taller!
Again it writhed itself into greater height, its long cloak
billowing, and again! Just before gaining the covert of branches, it
turned toward us a moment, twice the height of a man. And its
head, if head it had, was only a pointed thing with unguessable
features in the cavern of its hood. The moon was absolutely
overcast when the figure, again wheeling about, went beneath the
trees.</p>

<p>“Do we go after it?” I asked sardonically.</p>

<p>“We—we do not.”</p>

<p>“Righto.”</p>

<p>I heard a gurgle from Oxford’s lips and guessed that his
heart must be rotating in his throat. His shoulder to my touch
was quivering, and while we went to rejoin the rest he staggered
as if in drink, although certainly sober. But his nerves
aren’t the best, I shouldn’t wonder, for there must be regular
occasions when he quaffs and quaffs again.</p>

<p>They were a chastened, vaguely murmurous company we
discovered almost beneath the arch of the ancient gate-house
with its ivy swarming up and up, now standing lone, its walls
on either side all shorn away. Only a spurt or two of a match
they had to see by, until I came with my torch and they made
way for me. The light on the weather-beaten stone was
like the circle of an old medallion or mellowed painting: two
women, one pallid and lifeless, the other, seated on the grass,
supporting the lovely, unconscious head on her knees.</p>

<p>I supposed instantly that this was the young English-woman,
Millicent Mertoun, who lay wan—the most beautiful creature,
I believe, I have ever seen. Fine breeding, fine spirit were in her
stricken face. Cold loveliness, indeed, with the life gone out of
it; eyes set widely apart, closed beneath straight black eyebrows
which were now lifted apeak with the intensity of strain that
showed in the fine lines across her forehead and the slight
drawing-back of her short upper lip, disclosing her large, evenly
graduated teeth. The lashes that rested upon her cheeks were
remarkably long, deep black, and it was their fragile, almost
imperceptible stirring alone that betokened a possible reawakening
to life. Her chin was softly rounded, and in the disorder of her
abundant black hair a delicate ear was exposed. The suspension
of life had withdrawn the blood from the full-contoured lips,
left the cheeks pallid, but while I gazed at the face and the
aristocratic little neck, twined about so by the tumbling length
of masses of black hair, I had a whisper of what beauty the face
might have when expression was restored to it, and the eyes, of
unguessable depth and sweetness, were open.</p>

<p>Of the other woman’s head I caught only the partly averted
profile, while she bent over Miss Mertoun, with one hand clasping
together at the throat the unconscious girl’s loose gown,
apparently a garment of negligée. She, of course, must be the
American girl, for it was at the sound of her voice that Sean
Cosgrove had torn across the lawn. There was dignity, I
thought, in her head with its straitly fastened golden-brown hair,
and a lovely tenderness in the solicitude of her pose.</p>

<p>She was in the midst of speech, relating the adventure which
had brought her and her companion to that plight. She did not
look up or turn her head when the light from my hand broke
over her, and all the while she spoke her watchful gaze was for
the features of the girl whose senses were benumbed. American
speech it was, yet the words came from her lips with a chiselled
precision, the tone tending toward viola depth.</p>

<p>“—blinding, yes, not blinding alone, but maddening. I got
her into looser clothing—she wouldn’t go to bed. She gave no
sign of fainting, but the pain drove her into delirium more than
once, and I almost sent for someone else to help me with her.
Then the pain went down, and suddenly she went to sleep.”</p>

<p>Someone, I think Cosgrove, took a step nearer. “No, keep
away, please. Don’t try to move her yet.”</p>

<p>“But, Paula, how did you ever come—?”</p>

<p>The American girl precluded the end of Alberta Pendleton’s
question. “Of course I am coming to that. She went sound
asleep, and I thought it better not to undress her; so I let her lie
on the bed, and I curled up in the chair by the window. Millicent’s
wretched evening had left me tired out, too, and I don’t
remember anything more until when I woke up to find her
awake again and wandering about. There was enough light from
the globe by the mirror to see that she was terribly distressed,
but it was not with pain this time. She was suffering from
some—”</p>

<p>Paula Lebetwood hesitated for a moment, then
recommenced. “I think she was walking in her sleep.”</p>

<p>A note of surprise and pity came from all our mouths.</p>

<p>“Were her eyes open?” asked Mrs. Belvoir.</p>

<p>“Yes, with the darkest vagueness in them.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she recognize you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You see, it all happened so quickly. Only a couple of seconds
after I had roused myself the clock in the Hall of the Moth
commenced ringing midnight. Millicent stopped for a moment
and put her hand to her heart, a queer thing, I thought. ‘It’s his
music,’ she said, and made for the door.”</p>

<p>Renewed exclamations of surprise attested our close-held
interest.</p>

<p>“She ran down the hall—”</p>

<p>“But, Paula, did you let her—?”</p>

<p>“She was too strong for me, or perhaps too quick. She twisted
away from me when I tried to prevent her from leaving the
room. She almost flew down the hall; I was afraid she would
throw herself down the stairs, and I caught up with her just
in time. We came down—”</p>

<p>“Did she make any sound?” burst in Pendleton.</p>

<p>“Yes, a wailing sound—if there were any words, I couldn’t
distinguish them. Didn’t you hear her? Oh, I was wishing you
would. I didn’t dare to cry out, you know, since she was in that
dangerous state.”</p>

<p>“We heard, dear,” said Alberta Pendleton. “But the sound
kept changing, and we were undecided.”</p>

<p>“She had a definite intention to go out, and out of the front
entrance we went whether I would or not. And then, then, while
we were far away on the lawn, we saw the—the—I can’t name
it.”</p>

<p>“What was it like?” asked Pendleton, and I recall that all of
us closed in a little further to hear.</p>

<p>“The head, I suppose you’d call it. It was—awful.”</p>

<p>“What—where?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t any of you see it?” she asked in much surprise, yet not
for a second lifting her intent look from Millicent Mertoun’s
face. “It was just after that I noticed that foul reek of blood.”</p>

<p>“Blood!” That was Eve Bartholomew’s cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, haven’t you noticed that either? The smell was so
bad, I feared it would have some ghastly effect on Millicent.
I hoped she wouldn’t notice it, in her condition. And
then—we were beyond the gate-house, coming back toward the
mansion, when we saw—the head.”</p>

<p>“Where, for God’s sake?”</p>

<p>“About a hundred feet away from us. I heard something
stirring first, something scuttling, you might say. Then we saw
it. Ugh! . . . Straight out of hell, surely. . . .”</p>

<p>Pendleton’s excitement was getting too much for him, and
he broke through courtesy. “Why do you keep boggling it?
Where was it? What did it do?”</p>

<p>“Crofts!” reprimanded Alberta.</p>

<p>Still with averted face, Paula Lebetwood tried to satisfy our
fuming host. “Where? I don’t know exactly where. Near the
gate-house here, I suppose. It seemed thirty or forty yards away.
It was enormous, about six feet high—oh, fully that. It hung
in the air—there wasn’t any body beneath. And it didn’t do
anything, just remained there long enough to be seen, half a
second, perhaps, and disappeared with a sort of sigh. I thought I
heard a sigh. It—well, it simply went out. . . . It was
hideous.”</p>

<p>“What did it look like, dear?” asked Alberta, more to
anticipate her bluff husband than to satisfy curiosity, for her
question was tremulous.</p>

<p>“Hideous—a great round head with red goggle eyes and a
hole for a nose and broken teeth all grinning. It looked alive and
staring—worse than any mask I’ve ever seen—an indecent thing. . . .
Oh, don’t think that it was hallucination—poor Millicent
saw it too, though it came and went like the winking of an eye.
It seemed to strike to her heart—and to mine, for that
matter—and she could manage to walk only a few steps more—on my
arm—through the archway before she weakened and collapsed,
and I saw you all there outside the french window, and called.”</p>

<p>She turned her head full toward us for the first time since
Oxford and I had come from our private chase. Such was my
position when she lifted her bent head that I, and only I, saw,
on the yellow-lit ground revealed beyond, a small placard with
uncouth letters thereon, large enough to be read in spite of their
unshapeliness:</p>

<blockquote class="placard">

  <p>PARSON LOLLY SeNds REGaRDs LooK OUT
  FOR PARSON LOLLY</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A storm sprang in my mind, such a whirlwind of spirit as I
believe I have never before experienced, when behind the quick,
expectant face of this American girl, one so tender to her
stricken friend, one so fearless, I saw that obscene sign. She was
at first dazzled by the light in my hand, and her dark blue
eyes show wonderfully bright and wild. Her gold hair then had
a fine-spun beauty. And beside the old gate-tower lay the
sneering message of one who affronted both manhood and womanhood.
Anger at the marauder who made beauty his victim, shame
for being duped, fear of being duped again, a craving to bring
the rascal down—these and I know that not what other unleashed
gales met in the cross-roads of my mind. The winds rose
to raving, towered into hurricanes. My soul was dizzy,
staggering. I was not rational at that moment—then the gales went
down. I bit my lip hard, stepped around the two women there,
picked up the sign (which had been printed with a smudgy
pencil on a stiff folio sheet) and showed it to the rest.</p>

<p>“Parson Lolly!” exclaimed more than one.</p>

<p>Then Oxford, perhaps intending to be jocose, said,</p>

<p>“ ‘Beware of Parson Lolly.’ Beggar’s a bit late, it seems to
me.”</p>

<p>“At least,” said Crofts Pendleton thickly “it proves he’s
human—the devil!”</p>

<p>“<em>In some ways human</em>, perhaps,” amended Maryvale.</p>

<p>“What else, then?”</p>

<p>“Less than human. Consider the birds of the air, my friends.
They are, I suppose, less than human—yet—they—can—fly!”</p>

<p>I gave a stout shrug to rid myself of the disquiet compelled by
such a suggestion.</p>

<p>Anxiety over Miss Mertoun’s exposure to the midnight air
prompted Alberta Pendleton, not for the first time, to urge
taking her inside the Hall. But Miss Lebetwood shook her head in
a determined manner, and with a gesture showed that she
believed it was too far to carry her to the mansion.</p>

<p>“It’s very mild out here now,” she declared. “I know sleep-walking
people. If she were to wake up while she’s being taken,
it might have some long-lasting ill effect. Alberta, please don’t
ask again. I want her to be in my arms when she opens her
eyes. You good people don’t need to stay. I—and Sean—can wait
here with her alone.”</p>

<p>But none of us would go. Then while we waited to see a
greater sign of life than the restlessness of those long black lashes
on the pallid cheek, down from the dark north came that ragged,
hungry voice I had heard while alone earlier in the night, a
cry that tore at our nerves and congealed our blood to ice-drops
in our veins. A carnal, raving cry, thinning to a shriek that
pierced the ear, swelling to a howl that loosened the knees.</p>

<p>Of that dire, abysmal wail of mad desire, an overtone must
have found a counterpart in Cosgrove’s spirit. Out of the past
of his kind, that had seen things more clearly in the dusk than
in the plain light of day, that had loved cries of battle and death
more than joyful cries, some strain may have wrung the man’s
soul. Terribly to all of us, he raised his voice in answer to the
inhuman call; I, at least, had no sense of body or of time and
place while he burst into a black rain of words, a torrent of
rancour, and defiance against the fiend of the pit, whose
incarnate self he seemed to hear in the voice of the beast.</p>

<p>But a low call from Paula Lebetwood reduced him to a
stunning silence. “I think she’s coming to.”</p>

<p>The unconscious girl’s fingers fluttered briefly; her lips
stirred; her whole body stirred a little. She turned once, twice,
restlessly, and sank, with a little sigh, comfortably and
trustingly into the American girl’s embrace. The trace of a sneer
had vanished from her face, and her breast moved with her
breathing.</p>

<p>“She’s sleeping now,” said Alberta Pendleton, and stooped
beside the pair on the grass.</p>

<p>Miss Lebetwood whispered, “Dearest, do you hear me? Do
you know me? It’s Paula. . . . Dearest, do you hear me?” She
stroked the pale forehead free of its last furrow.</p>

<p>“Yes,” came like a shadow of a word from the sleeping girl.</p>

<p>“Dearest, Paula wants you to come with her.” Still she spoke,
soothing, caressing, in the effort to woo her to awaken
peacefully. And the eyes of Millicent Mertoun opened, revealing
themselves to be of a deep blackness that rivalled her errant hair,
opened to see only the smile of love on the face of the American
girl bending over her; and the English girl smiled too.</p>

<p>“Your headache is all gone, isn’t it, dearest?”</p>

<p>“Yes . . . but where . . . is this?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened, dear. It’s the lawn by the gate-house.
Now we’re going inside.”</p>

<p>“But how? . . . I don’t understand . . . these people.”</p>

<p>Miss Lebetwood kissed her cheek, leaned her forehead against
it. “Never mind, dearest. Everyone is a friend, you know. Can
you walk? Here, now.”</p>

<p>The English girl was sitting up; she rubbed her eyes, and
sent short, bewildered looks this way and that, far from
comprehending her situation. Too many of the party were trying to
explain everything to her, and she was beginning to look
desperate and unhappy.</p>

<p>“Never mind the silly people,” said Miss Lebetwood sensibly.
“See—we’re just a few steps away from the house—where we’ve
been before, you know. Now we must go in. Sean, help me.”</p>

<p>The Irishman and the women at last began to support the
strengthless girl into the Hall. It must have been a full quarter
of an hour since we had poured out from that vaulted chamber
into the enigmatic night and had heard the call from the
gate-house. Now the servants were roused, summoned by someone,
and lanterns were rushing across the lawn in our direction. I
had commenced to go with the party about Miss Mertoun,
desirous of casting a light before their feet. But Pendleton called
me back somewhat peremptorily.</p>

<p>“Bright enough from the Hall for ’em not to stumble by.”
Alone in the great mansion the Hall of the Moth sparkled forth,
but the glare from its massive chandelier was a sure guiding
light. “We need you here,” added our host; “there’s a good deal
more of this needs looking at.”</p>

<p>At a phrase from him the lanterns began to swing hither and
thither about the lawn, and we men of the party passed across
the drawbridge under the resounding gate-house arch.</p>

<p>“Is this usually lowered?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Usually. Can be raised for the sport of it. It’s part of the
main drive, you see. It must have been hereabout that they
smelt—”</p>

<p>He had no need to say more.</p>

<p>“Great God, what an unholy stench!”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> blood!”</p>

<p>“Bottles of it.”</p>

<p>Crofts Pendleton’s voice shook. “I hope—it’s not—anything
serious.”</p>

<p>Just then nothing could have struck us as amusing. Lord
Ludlow interjected, “Remember, sir, that there is a missing
man—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, look there! My boot!”</p>

<p>Belvoir lifted a foot for inspection, while I turned the eye
of the torch upon it. The leather was stained with a fluid dark
and thick.</p>

<p>“My God!” observed Pendleton.</p>

<p>“It’s jolly well begun to clot.”</p>

<p>“Look out, you chaps, you’ll mire yourselves.”</p>

<p>“Show us the place, Bannerlee.”</p>

<p>My torch exposed a patch of darkened grass only a foot or
so each way. There was nothing else about nearby.</p>

<p>Pendleton, half aghast, kneeled on the edge of the patch and
studied it.</p>

<p>“A lot of blood’s been spilled here. It must have soaked down,
a goodish bit of it, but there’s quite a pool about the grass roots.
This spot will have to be guarded to-night. Pity we’ve tramped
about.”</p>

<p>A thick voice lifted in excitement from the north of us.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mister Crofts, sir, do come here.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Tenney? Let it stay, whatever it is.”</p>

<p>“Small fear I’ll touch it, sir. It’s one of them old fightin’
irons.”</p>

<p>“A weapon, by heaven!” exclaimed Lord Ludlow.</p>

<p>“Has it blood on it?”</p>

<p>“All sticky dried, sir.”</p>

<p>We were beside the quaking man-servant in a jiffy or two,
staring curiously where lay a small battle-axe, with an
inconsiderable curve of blade. It was a weapon of uncommon
slightness. Both metal and wood were dark with the same viscous
fluid, the handle being quite slobbered with it.</p>

<p>“From the armoury!” cried our host. “The foul devil’s
actually been inside the house! Don’t touch it!”</p>

<p>“That weapon was on the wall at a quarter before eight,”
said Lord Ludlow. (Ah, I knew why he could say that!) “I
was passing through to the library for my glasses.” (There, to
be sure, the old rascal prevaricated.)</p>

<p>“You don’t say!”</p>

<p>“This looks like a serious crime,” remarked his Lordship.</p>

<p>“Serious crime!” Pendleton snorted. “Ludlow, you surprise
me. I thought it was child’s play.”</p>

<p>“I think that by a serious crime our noble friend means a
particular crime—don’t you, Ludlow? Isn’t it the customary
euphemism?” asked Belvoir.</p>

<p>“I mean murder, sir.”</p>

<p>“Should have said so in the first place,” growled Pendleton,
and added, “No need to say it at all.”</p>

<p>“It’s jolly irregular, though,” declared Oxford. “All that
blood in one spot, and this gory thing over here.”</p>

<p>“This was not done according to rule,” rejoined his Lordship.</p>

<p>“It was not carried out as planned,” declared Cosgrove, who
had come out from the mansion again.</p>

<p>“And one, er, detail only needs to be filled in.” That was
Belvoir from somewhere in the darkness behind us. “The,
er, <i>corpus delicti</i>.”</p>

<p>“Gad, yes—scatter, now—search—all the way to Aidenn
Water.”</p>

<p>The cluster of lanterns spread into kaleidoscopic figures again,
although the men seemed none too happy to leave the protection
of one another. But they did not discover any further traces of
the marauder or a vestige of a victim who might have furnished
all that blood. My own light picked up the last find of the night,
a round, battered object on the grass even further north than
the blood-stained axe.</p>

<p>“A hat!”</p>

<p>“Can it be Sir Brooke’s?”</p>

<p>Pendleton leaped ahead of us and snatched it from the ground,
held it from him contemptuously.</p>

<p>“I doubt it.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you certainly that it is not Sir Brooke’s!”</p>

<p>One man, at least, jumped at the sound of a female voice
among us. There was Eve Bartholomew, standing tall and
tragic, clinging, I thought, to the last pinch of nerve she
possessed.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help being interested, you know,” she remarked
ingenuously, and gave a little high-keyed laugh. “I just came
from the Hall. But I can assure you that Sir Brooke has nothing
to do with this affair. He would be mad to take any part
in it. He would be mad to wear that rag of a disreputable
hat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Bartholomew,” I agreed, “he would. I was about
to say, before you identified the hat as not Sir Brooke’s, that it
belongs to me. I wore it down the slopes of Aidenn Vale.”</p>

<p>“You did!”</p>

<p>“Yes—none too new when I set forth with it this morning,
it has suffered a lifetime’s wear and tear with me to-day. That
is the history of the hat.”</p>

<p>“But where did you see it last?” demanded Pendleton.</p>

<p>“I left it hanging in the entrance-hall. And I saw it on the
rack as you and I came down the stairs before we went in to the
Bidding Feast.”</p>

<p>“By gad, I remember it too,” he assented. “Then if—”</p>

<p>But he never finished that sentence, whose protases and apodoses
might have filled an hour. Quick with surmise, we turned
back to the house.</p>

<p>Millicent Mertoun and her retinue had by this time gone
upstairs, but the Hall of the Moth was full of the women-servants
of the house, arrayed in white as if risen from their
graves in winding sheets. A small boy in a nightgown, scared
half to death, was blubbering soulfully, as were some of the
women. Blenkinson, the butler, the only man of them who had
not got into clothes and gone forth, was quieting everyone with
loud sibilance.</p>

<p>Pendleton confronted them somewhat nervously.</p>

<p>“There’s been too much racket about nothing,” he asserted.
“Miss Mertoun walked a little in her sleep. That’s really
all that’s happened. You’re all very silly, you see, to take on so.
Now get to bed.”</p>

<p>But when they had departed he turned upon Eve Bartholomew
with a face full of bale. “I can tell you one thing about
Sir Brooke. If he doesn’t show up to-morrow and clear things
up a bit, he’ll find no Bidding Feast when he gets here. I’ll
invite ’em to clear out. I’m not going to have my guests hounded
and threatened.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartholomew gasped. “Why, you can’t say that Sir
Brooke has anything—”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” scowled Pendleton, “but I want
him—here!”</p>

<p>We are truly blissful marriage celebrators.</p>

<p>. . . . A thought had been germinating in my mind ever since
the moment of my near-madness on the lawn, when the iniquity
of Parson Lolly had so taken hold of me. When we were alone:</p>

<p>“Crofts, I want to prove I’m not crazy. Show me where you
want me to sleep, and give me a book to write in. And keep it
quiet, for heaven’s sake.”</p>

<p>“A book to write in?”</p>

<p>“I have many words within me craving to be penned. Give
me a book to write in, and show me my room.”</p>

<p>Well, this is the room, and these some of the words.</p>

<p>Now to tell of the many things that happened to me to-day
before these many things.</p>

<h2>II. <br> The Bull</h2>

<p class="diarydate">Yesterday at one o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>About this time I was sitting on a damp sharp
stone, looking about me and seeing nothing. I had walked for a
long while and gotten nowhere. For there was persistent mist
still in the uplands, and I had strayed into the thick of it and
was hopelessly befogged, hungry, and a trifle anxious about the
probable duration of my helplessness.</p>

<p>My thoughts just then were largely retrospect. I had set
out from—well, I have forgotten the spelling of the place, but
it’s no matter.<a href="#note1" id="noteref1">¹</a>
The names in Wales have fascinating orthography
and, to one not adept, rather unobvious pronunciations.
I had set out from this place which must be anonymous in
order to search for something that had not been seen for several
centuries, the private oratory or shrine or cell of St. Tarw, a
rather unbelievable name, or, in the American idiom, a bully
one, whichever way you look at it, for a Welsh saint. It’s one
that anybody can say without arduous practice. The saint himself
was a rather incredible individual. It happens that I know
something of saints, they being a particular hobby of mine, and
yet I was uncertain at that moment whether St. Tarw was a
man or was a whisper on the faëry breeze of legend. But as it
happened, in the course of researches in London, I found hints
that, man or whisper, he had left or there had been left for him
in what to-day is Radnorshire, a monument of stone in which
he did his devotions, or had been believed to do them.</p>

<p>It was in the Book of Sylvan Armitage that I ran across the
clue. The Book is a chronicle of the diversions of a sixteenth-century
gentleman, and mine is a genuine first printing of 1598.
It contains an allusion which I am confident refers to a
performance of the “Merchant of Venice” at Blackfriars, which
allusion would stagger the erudite who prate glibly of the “order
of Shakespeare’s plays,” if they gave it a thought. But much
more interesting to me is the reference to the devotional seat
of St. Tarw.</p>

<p>Sylvan Armitage, progressing through Wales in 1594, visited
the house of an Englishman residing in that lately
war-distraught country. On one of their “long gaddynges and
peregrinations afoot,” for riding was not feasible among these
broken mountains, they came upon a humble structure of “hewn
stones, much dishevelled and marvellously coated by moss,”
says Sylvan Armitage. He adds that the “cella” had been built
under a bank, and that this very fact was then threatening its
existence. Small chance of success then for me.</p>

<p>So yesterday while I sat on my ungrateful seat with the mist
wreathing about me, I half-abandoned the search before it had
properly begun. For the dozenth time I took out the letter I
had received the day before from my dear old friends, Jack and
Mary Bonnet of Bristol. Their barque, recently returned from
Australia, will leave the dry-dock in a day or so and take the
sea again from Bristol next Monday. Would I join them in a
“terror and pleasure” trip somewhere around Africa or the
Scandinavian coast? Of course, I reflected, it would take me
fully a week to wind up my affairs in preparation for such an
ocean journey. I must drop the saint business. I looked at the
fog, felt sick of saints, and almost decided I would go.</p>

<p>I had let down my burden, a soldier’s knapsack and a fairly
well-loaded one, to the grass beside my feet. I decided to eat
my luncheon. I tucked the Bonnet letter away and took out
my beef-sandwiches, milk in a thermos-flask, and walnut meats,
a substantial meal in small compass. My long morning’s tramp
on the uplands had made me very hungry. It was not only
the tramp, but the slipping and falling and crawling, for the
yellow grass was long and trodden flat by cattle, making the
side slopes very toilsome, and, in the mist, risky, for you
sometimes did not know whether you might fall ten feet or a
thousand.</p>

<p>I had been exploring Aidenn Forest, but I had early left the
lowland area of trees. The uplands, miles of broad-topped hills
in a range of horseshoe shape, were given over largely to
cattle-grazing. There were long pastures of rolling and heaving slopes,
like the gently-breathing ocean of midsummer. My meal over,
I unfolded my contour-map of the Geographical Institute and
pondered over it, trying by recollection and inference to
determine just where I was. But I had not the remotest clue to
slope or distance. I might have been at one extreme of the
horseshoe or the other, or any spot betwixt. It was two o’clock.</p>

<p>Neither my literary nor my philosophic studies, which are
supposed to chasten the mind to resignation, comforted my
thoughts in the least, but suddenly I was aware of a change in
the atmosphere. The mist seemed suffused with silver, then with
gold. Soon the phantoms of fog had retracted far on either side
in lofty, shifting, sun-rayed banks, and the air became clear
about me. But I remained in doubt about my position.</p>

<p>For the mist had cleared only to the shoulders of the hills,
and left the rolling heights a-sparkle like early morning; but
the valleys and the great outer hills of Wales, girding Aidenn
Forest, were blind to me. From the declining sun I could tell
which way was west, but knowledge of that direction alone
was no use. Was I on the western curve of the horseshoe or the
opposite? Nor did it help to recall that my ascent of Aidenn
Forest had been the north, where the two curves meet, the open
part of the horseshoe being to the south. I was as confused as
ever.</p>

<p>At least I could walk freely, keep to the smooth uplands
without peril of falling down some gap or gully. I strode on in
the grandeur of the sun, the mighty halo of mist extending a
mile all around, a more gorgeous glory than bully St. Tarw or
any other of the blessed men of earth ever wore. The towering
wall of mist was warm with the light that occasionally melted
through and dazzled the ragged hill-slope underneath; the
cloud-caps wreathed and spired like golden smoke, and I went
on proudly and merrily in my enormous prison. I felt like a
god, exultant. I reached out my hands and lifted my face to the
heavens. My loneliness apotheosized me. I laughed. I
shouted, <i>ebriatus</i>. Never before have I experienced that sense of space
and power, that vigour beyond muscle and sense, that reckless
rapture!</p>

<p>Nearly an hour passed. Grasshoppers leapt to either side of
my path with little soft comings to earth; the sound was like
the first drops of rain. Black-game and grouse twice or thrice
scampered and scudded from my feet, and suddenly out of the
fog which had closed in on my left swept a great bevy of
unknown birds with a thunder of wings. I judged then that I
was not far from the brink of a steep pitch on the edge of the
uplands. The mist which had glorified me was beginning to
hem me more straitly and I bore away to the right, being wary
of pitfalls.</p>

<p>Gradually, while I moved up and down the placid slopes and
crossed wide expanses wherein I was an ephemeral topic for
cows and shambling tattered ponies, an inexpressible sense told
me precisely where I was on the lofty horseshoe of Aidenn
Forest. Fragmentary half-submerged memories of my contour-map,
of the dip of the slopes where I trod, of instructions proffered
me by scraggy, wry-spoken yokels (with obligato of a pig
screaming at a gate), of the arc described by the sun, of the
bated breath of the breeze—all these united to fix my certainty.
My feet just at that moment were ascending on the flattened
grass of a small summit; Mynydd Tarw I knew it was, whose
highest spot was considerably above two thousand feet. Mynydd
Tarw, on the verge of the horseshoe’s eastern bend, was where
I had concluded the oratory of St. Tarw was most likely to be
found.</p>

<p>I explored the hill and all about, but unfortunately it was
creased and gorged by channels, tiny valleys. Trees and rank
underbrush grew in these troughs, increasing in thickness down
the declivity, and the banners of mist were tangled in the trees.
The trunks were clammy, the fallen leaves dank, the earth too
soft for good footing. My shoes sank over the ankles in leaves
and loam. Bereft of my halo, I had little joy. And after an
hour of climbing up and down, groping and grasping, of peering
for traces of foundered or buried walls, I realized, with a
shock that sickened me, that I was out of my reckoning in the
lower fog again, and that I could not trace my way back. I
could not even tell in which direction Mynydd Tarw lay.</p>

<p>I was almost frantic. It was now past mid-afternoon, less
than two hours before sunset, and had I known the bee-line to
my hostel in the difficultly-pronounced village, I could not have
reached it before darkness had long covered Wales.</p>

<p>The valleys, immersed in mist below me, were a wilderness,
and broad of expanse; once on the uplands again, however, I
believed I could find Mynydd Tarw, and thence strike on the
true way home. As for exploring the Vale of Aidenn Water
itself, I had no reason to believe that man had ever built a
habitation there. To regain the uplands was my anxious wish;
but not even this was an easy feat. I was weary already, from
physical exertion and strain of mind, but it should have been
easy to keep my course upward, however slow my progress. Yet
the yellow grass and the heather was flat and long, and
whether still dry or drenched with fog, slippery and maddening
to ascend upon. Moreover, I would find myself in channels torn
and scarred by water, now streamless in summer season, but
choked with thorny creepers and thick spear-like stalks in
malign barriers.</p>

<p>But I persevered, although I found the mist had grown
thicker above as day declined. Presently I recognized the sweet
smell of new-cut hay in fields above me, and soon afterward
kneeing myself to the sharp edge of a parapet of rock, I rejoiced
to see the smoky round of the sun. There was a line of wild
apple-trees along the rim of the uplands at this point. The
crooked branches and straggling shoots of them made them all
like black hats of witches wreathed with tattered ribbons, save
for the one directly before me, through whose limbs half-despoiled
of leaves the sun sent a wicked leering shine that made
me singularly uneasy.</p>

<p>I had come into a region thickly populated with cattle. There
were a score on the hillock to my right, and when I had gone
thence over a bristling wire fence I found a hundred more filling
the twilight plain with their shadows. There was not a sound
from the widespread throng, but I had a feeling that each
dispassionate bovine head was turned toward me, and I advanced
with something of the shyness of a child crossing a drawing-room
where he feels every eye cold and critical. A little the
uncanny sense gripped me that I had happened upon some
land undiscovered by Gulliver, where cows were people, and
very superior people. There had been so few of them visible all
day, now so many; I could not rid myself of the notion that I
was an intruder. (Just then the reasonable explanation did not
occur to me that atmospheric conditions had much to do with
the migrations of the beasts from place to place on the
horseshoe.)</p>

<p>Across an unkempt stone wall which I whipped up laggard
muscles to leap—I was going rapidly—sweet-fleshed sheep,
of orthodox tan, the cross of Welsh mountain breed with
black-faced “Shrops,” were nudging one another in an anxious mass.
I looked toward the sinking sun and discerned a black rift
perhaps a mile distant: the Vale of Aidenn Water, with the
prominences of the western arm of the horseshoe, Great Rhos,
Esgair Nantau, and Vron Hill, nosing up to the sky even
another mile beyond.</p>

<p>Then down on me came dark ruin with a rush.</p>

<p>I was aware appallingly of some vaster shadow blotting out
the gorgeous disc which lay on the western hills, a shadow
blatant, militant, perilous. A sting of fear in my breast goaded
me to instant flight; I was plunging away all in an instant,
every part of me in panic, without realization of what it was
from which I fled.</p>

<p>Ten seconds of rushing flight, a frantic glance behind me,
and my returning faculties told me what that fell form was,
horned and pawed, with cavorting death-like head and eyes
evilly a-gleam, the shape rampaging, the feet tremendous on the
shaken ground. I knew too well those signs of the Hereford
breed, the twining horns and the white face so startlingly
suggestive of the skull beneath. It was a bull, the hugest bull on
earth, insane with murderous passion.</p>

<p>Terror winged me in that course for life. Once I stumbled
and rolled down a slope littered with small stones, but my speed
was scarcely lessened. I must have regained my feet, for I
drove myself through a patch of merciless nettles and awful
thorns, yet was hardly sensible of being torn and stabbed. Not
until long afterward did I feel the heavy bruise, like the mark
of an iron palm, which my hard and firmly fastened pack had
printed between my shoulder-blades, saving me a worse blow.
Now my due training for the mile at the University, not so
very long ago, and the desire for strict regimen then instilled in
me, and my frequent jaunts on foot through broad countrysides,
were in good stead. In the beginning of this breathless chase, I
had had a wide margin of advantage, and now I was all but
holding my own, when ahead of me I saw deliverance. For I
had turned westward in flight across the leveller hilltop, and
the brink of the Vale of Aidenn Water, with its slope looking a
precipice all around and its hollow now a mammoth bowl of
impenetrable fog, was less than a furlong away ahead.</p>

<p>Risk had to be taken to make safety sure. I chanced another
ugly fall by a quick twist of my neck. I led by twenty yards.
Gradually, therefore, I diminished my pace so that at the verge
of the cliff only ten feet might separate us—and just before I
would have leaped out into the turbid air, I used every remaining
particle of strength in a sidewise lunge downward to the
grass, letting the bull flash with unconquerable momentum over
the edge.</p>

<p>But I myself was a vessel of momentum and could not by
any frantic clutching and clawing soever keep myself from
sliding over the brink and slipping from an abrupt decline to a
sharper one, whence with horrified mind I felt myself go over
the verge of nothingness! While I fell backward with eyes staring
to the lurid sky, I saw the hulk of the bull shoot out from
the summit of the cliff. Never have I seen a thing as black as
the mass of the beast, with limbs winnowing in the air and head
and vast nose outstretched. The black body would have crushed
me to pulp had I not flung myself aside a moment before. I know
that I must have been still in the air when the bull struck a
thrust-out ledge far below the cliff—I had caught just an
instant’s glare of one eye, demoniac and hopeless—then the
animal went bellowing and thumping down through the fog into
unseen depths until one final crash and cry ended sound in
ghastly silence.</p>

<h2>III. <br> The House</h2>

<p>I don’t suppose I was in the air a second, but there
was time enough for me to rue my neglect of Jack Bonnet’s
invitation. Why hadn’t I turned round and gone away from the
Forest and let the oratory go hang?</p>

<p>I was aware soon afterward that I was still alive in a queer
place under the shelter of the hilltop, a place all caved-in earth
and half-buried squarish rock, like heavy tombstones thickly
lichened, and resting, some of them, one upon the other. I was
on my back with my head on a pillow of fungi; beneath
the pillow, however, was a sufficiently flinty foundation. For a
long time I remained supine, and listened with interest while
my heart gradually resumed a normal rate. The upper tangle
of the fog was just beyond and below me; yet when I looked
at the dark brink above, I realized that never, never could I
climb back at the spot where I had fallen. But I felt a great
gladness.</p>

<p>I explored the place little more than was necessary to get my
bearings. So upon regaining enough strength I commenced to
creep along the face of the cliff, now and then dipping into the
region of the mist and losing sight of the sky, which was growing
desolate of light. At length I found a slope where the grass
was short and turf firm, a sward. I went now at a pace between
a walk and a run and congratulated myself on making headway,
though the brow of the ravine was forbidding above me still.
Then the bank became startlingly overgrown with trees, and the
drizzle was thicker among them.</p>

<p>I slowed to a snail’s pace, and that was well for me. All too
soon my foot gave way on the left-hand edge of a mass of
undergrowth quite impenetrable to sight. I struggled to take hold of
something, did, in fact, grasp stems that yielded instantly to my
weight, for they were frail and grew on a perpendicular face
of earth. Once more I had the exquisitely dreadful sensation of
falling whither I could not tell. My body ripped down through
a mesh and tangle of shrubs that availed almost nothing to stay
my descent. I accelerated.</p>

<p>Then my ribs struck a goodly branch with a knock that did
indeed break my fall, but before I could twine an arm about this
saviour, I had jounced to a lower branch, thence to the ground,
this time with only a moderate jar.</p>

<p>I was on a narrow rocky path with the densely overgrown
hill on one hand and the mist of the Vale—yawning space—on
the other. I thought for a flash that I had invaded the
home-ledge of some unrecorded ape or gorilla. For a creature cried
out in my very face, a man coming up, as it were, out of the
living rock of the path before me. He was fustian-clad, heavy-set,
dark-featured, scowling frightfully, and my impression was
that he was almost spent of breath. His mouth gaped in a rictus
of strain and fear.</p>

<p>“Mawkerdjey—immilath acowal!” So they sounded, the
words he spat in my face, the shout he shouted uninterpretable
by my English ears in that cranny of Wales. But meaningless
as was the shout to me, it remained clear in my auditive memory,
as a scene sometimes is keenly limned in one’s inattentive sight.
And I was sure it was not Welsh. Nor was this because Radnorshire
is a backsliding county where the ancient language has
yielded to the new. The shape and stress of the cry were unlike
what speech I have heard in the remoter areas where Welsh is
still spoken.</p>

<p>In an instant the fellow had scuffled past me and was ascending
in the fog, while yet I leaned on my hand with buzzing
senses and jerky mind. I staggered to my feet and looked upward
along the path. At the head of the rise a glimmer of sea-green
sunset-light lingered, and the broad bulk of the man staggered
against that semi-darkness, a diminishing silhouette. At length I
saw him reach the top of the rise, throw up his hands in a sort
of gesture of weary achievement, and disappear to the uplands
beyond.</p>

<p>Excitedly, and full of profitless conjecture as to what might
be his business upon the rolling solitudes of Aidenn Forest, I
turned on my way down the zigzag path, being resolved to explore
the Vale for shelter since now it was hopeless to make my
way over the fells and crags to my Welsh tavern lodging that
night. The outcry of the ape-like man was still distinct in my
ears, an undecipherable shout, one, I knew, strange even in this
region of strange tongues.</p>

<p>I had paused, arrested by a sound the like of which I have
never known, a roaring sound, not the boom of cannon or the
rage of water or the thunder of avalanche, all of which I have
heard. It came from below and far away, a gentle roar; I
thought it might be some superhuman voice. As a fact, while I
listened, I became convinced that it was a voice of great power
with something unique and quite baffling in its quality, one full
capable of terrifying a man of unsteady nerves. Yet I was sure
that in a different context I would recognize that quality as a
natural thing. The muffled echoes of the voice rocked around the
Vale; words I am sure there were, the same phrase or sentence
repeated many times, but the utmost strain of ear and faculties
did not enable me to distinguish the meaning of a syllable. Then
the distant shout and its reflections ceased, and I heard only the
still grasses. I went on, full of living fancies.</p>

<p>A new sound greeted me out of the darkness, the rippling
song of a nightingale on my right beyond the brink. The trees
in the depths of Aidenn Vale, then, must be near below. And
presently finding almost level ground, I heard the chuckle of
water, and discerned a lofty fall of dulled silver, indeed passed
it so close that the rising spray touched my cheek. Thus I had
found Aidenn Water, not far from its springs on the shoulder
of Black Mixen at the upper end of the horseshoe.</p>

<p>Straining my sight in the clogged air, I could trace the
black thread of the watercourse on my right hand. Beside it
I trod, to the broken descant of amorous birds. And while I
went the way of the stream south among the wilding trees, the
dark mist paled. I raised my eyes; great Whimble hill loomed
before me, and over its stern summit crept a chipped and
gibbous moon, softly lustering. While the moon went up the sky,
I trolled on southward in air grey and spectral under the
frowning summits of Aidenn Vale.</p>

<p>The pathway left the stream for a gentle rise through the
trees. Still I could hear Aidenn Water clamour down the Vale
while it skipped along. Soon I emerged from the thick of the
wood into an open space, the level summit of a vast mound, and
with a certain freshening of surprise found myself approaching
a lonely wall built by human strength.</p>

<p>A wall—no more—ruinous and desolate, toppled in many
places from its original height.</p>

<p>Passing closer, I discovered the confounded and scattered remnant
of other wasted walls, strewn like bones in the brightening
glamour of the moon. And midway among them stood one tree
of mighty stature, doubtless rendered even more towering by
the witchery of mist and moonlight.</p>

<p>Sometimes acoustic conditions prevent one from hearing what
goes on just round the corner only a few feet away. So, then,
my path led me toward the south-west end of the ruin, and precisely
at the standing angle of the stone I ran into another man.
I did literally run into him, for he was soft and spongy, and my
first feeling was that I had encountered a hot-water bottle
strolling as leisurely as if on the Mall.</p>

<p>We recoiled from a position cheek by jowl. A light flashed
in my eyes, and at the same instant I directed the glare of my
pocket-torch, which I still possessed, into his eyes. Our speeches,
too, crossed each other.</p>

<p>“Pardon! I didn’t hear you, sir!”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>It was not the greeting I had expected; in fact, I felt it quite
discourteous. Moreover, he kept the spot-light of his dark-lantern
playing on my features for some time, and his piercing
eyes studied me critically. In return I gave his exterior a good
scrutiny.</p>

<p>My light revealed a tall figure, appearing excessively,
grotesquely tall because it was wearing a very high, narrow
top-hat, almost a steeple-hat. The man was large and round as well
as long. His face compared with the rest of his body was
relatively narrow; I saw glittering eyes and a long, straight nose,
eyebrows black like coals, and a mantling, pointed beard, also
very thick and fiercely black. What gave me the creeps was that
this beard did not grow quite straight, but was tilted a little to
the left.</p>

<p>His clothing, I saw in this long dissection, was that of an
elderly man, a black double-breasted frock-coat, not cutaway,
and black trousers which descended to elastic-sided boots. And
under the arm toward which the beard slanted was lodged an
old, bulgy umbrella with a large metal handle. He quickly
shifted this article into his right hand, grasping it toward the
point so that it might be a weapon of considerable moment, his
left hand holding the dark-lantern.</p>

<p>He was the first to break the silence. Smiling, he replaced the
umbrella under his arm.</p>

<p>“Ah, pardon me, please. I see that you are on my side.” His
voice, now I noticed it, was rather deep, and yet rather young
for one of his solemn appearance.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m not against you,” I answered, and lowered my
light out of his eyes. He followed suit.</p>

<p>“You are one of the natives of this region?” he asked, and
with his question came the thought to me that he might be a
foreigner, although his full, somewhat throaty voice was perfectly
assimilated to the Anglican inflections. Those coat-skirts
somehow gave him a little of a Continental aspect—and that
umbrella! Didn’t Schubert always carry an umbrella? or was I
thinking of Paul Pry?</p>

<p>“I should say not,” I responded. “I, too, am a stranger.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you, <em>too</em>? What a pity!”</p>

<p>“Yes, am I not correct in believing that you—”</p>

<p>“Quite so, sir; my name, sir, is Septimus MacWilloughby,
and I was taught not far from Birmingham. And now, sir, will
you kindly tell me what you have been doing here?”</p>

<p>“Been doing? Doing? Why, nothing, in the sense you seem
to mean. And have you any business with me? Isn’t it rather—?”</p>

<p>“It is necessary.”</p>

<p>“I lost my way in fog up there on the hilltops and came down
into the Vale in the hope of finding some sort of shelter. I was
just passing by this—”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” said Mr. MacWilloughby, in what seemed
to me a rather meditative tone. “Tell me, please: in your
travelling to-day have you run across a very small grey spaniel,
with ink-spots?”</p>

<p>I was reduced to repeating, “With ink-spots?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly: I repeat, a small grey spaniel, with ink-spots.
The dog was not to blame if the bottle was too near the edge of
the table. No, I see that you have not. Well then, by chance you
may have seen a pair of Scandinavian ponies, both lame in the
off foreleg?”</p>

<p>“I certainly have not.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” sighed my interlocutor. He stabbed the ground
with his umbrella, leaned upon it with both hands, large, red,
bloated hands, nervously twitching fat fingers. “And finally,
did you notice whether any snakes—”</p>

<p>I was growing exasperated, whether or not this <i>soi-disant</i>
MacWilloughby was making merry at my expense.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know,” I asked harshly, “that there are no snakes
in Radnorshire?”</p>

<p>“But these were from my menagerie. Dear me, my menagerie
will be dreadfully depleted, I fear. You didn’t—?”</p>

<p>“Look here,” I exploded; “have you a Bull of Bashan on your
list? If you have, your bull’s dead—I can tell you so much. With
the exception of a cave-man who was running up the path there,
every animal I’ve seen has been indigenous.”</p>

<p>“But snakes—from my menagerie,” he protested mildly,
ignoring my tone. He indicated with the umbrella and his free
hand, for a pencil of moonlight from rifted clouds had caused
us both to stow away our torches. “Snakes about so long.”</p>

<p>“No, no!”</p>

<p>He shrugged disappointedly. “Well! if it must be. Then you
will tell me, please, which of these hills”—he included them all
with a sweep of the umbrella—“is called Kerry Hill?”</p>

<p>“Why, none of them. Kerry Hill is outside this county,
thirty miles away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so far away? Then I must be leaving at once. I have a
friend who lives in a little house on the top of that hill, and he
will be anxious for me.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Mr. MacWilloughby strode past me, but checked
himself. “Stay—what was that you said about a cave-man?”</p>

<p>I was willing to humour him a little longer. “Oh, I met <em>him</em>
right enough. He shouted some gibberish in my face and
passed me going to the uplands.”</p>

<p>“Oh? Now that is very good. You may think it inexcusable of
me, sir, but I had the idea for a little while that you were that
cave-man. I asked you those questions partly to hear a little of
your language. Now, since you say Kerry Hill is so far, I
really—”</p>

<p>He commenced to walk away, but I protested.</p>

<p>“I think it’s time you answered a question or two of mine.
I don’t know what possesses you to climb into that wilderness,
even if your whole menagerie is kicking its heels up there—they’ll
keep. But you can at least tell me what I’m likely to
find further down the Vale. Shall I find anyone there?”</p>

<p>The stranger’s face, in spite of its startling features, grew
really pleasant with a smile. “I believe you will find someone
further down. Yes, I believe you will find all you want.”</p>

<p>“I’m not looking for any special number of people,” I told
him tartly. “I want a house—shelter—a place to stop overnight.
Am I clear?”</p>

<p>Mr. MacWilloughby seemed to have lost interest in his
surroundings. In answer to my question he murmured, “Yes, you
are very likely to find a house,” but his thought seemed to be
running in other channels. He was biting the beard of his
nether lip. Suddenly he drew himself up. “You might mention—if
you decide to stop—to the master of the hostelry, that his
many watch-dogs are causing me inconvenience. Secretly, you
understand. All this you must tell him secretly. I enjoy the
society of the menagerie, and of many kinds of dogs—the
Russian wolf-hound, the Dalmatian—but I do not care for the
two-legged kind he has out to-night. It is not a thing I like to
mention, you understand—it is so delicate—but when one is
actually precluded from stepping across a stile—” Hand and
umbrella made an expressive gesture. “You catch my drift, I
perceive.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be sure to tell him,” I remarked sardonically.</p>

<p>“You will?” he exclaimed with a parade of pleasure. “Then
in that case I shall not need protection against the rain.”</p>

<p>His arm shot out, and I saw the umbrella fly up like a thick
javelin through the air, to disappear beyond the wall beside
which we stood.</p>

<p>“Another thing!” he cried, and I detected a real note of
sincerity in his tempestuous voice. “Tell the golden-haired woman
that I have warned her to beware of the blighter with the red
face and the pot of money. She should dismiss him—utterly. I
have seen what I have seen.”</p>

<p>I emitted a dry “No doubt.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir, for your great courtesy,” said Mr.
MacWilloughby. His lofty hat he removed with a flowing ease; he
bent his back in an old-time inclination. Then in the fluctuating
moonlight I saw not only black beard and brows, but as well
a wriggling mass of black hair. He was smiling, but his smile
now had a touch of wildness, even of ghoulishness. He set his
hat upon his brows again.</p>

<p>“I shall not need even finger-nails if I meet another like
you,” he said.</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and continued his stately promenade
toward the summit of the Vale. I watched him until the moon
surrendered and the mist had him. Where was he going? To
join that prehistoric man on the hill? And where in heaven’s
name had he come <em>from</em>?</p>

<p>Mad? Was he mad? No more mad than I. I realized,
the moment he had projected his umbrella, that he was
eminently sane. But he had overplayed his part a little—for his
audience.</p>

<p>Continuing on my southward way, I soon passed the site
of what had been the outer walls of this great castle, though
now little remained save one block of hewn stone upon another
here and there. Most of the material had probably been carried
off to build some mansion of a later age.</p>

<p>I left the ruin, advancing down the Vale, whose bounds of
lofty crag and hanger were darkly visible for a little while. But
I could not leave behind me the thought of the huge man and
his eccentric speeches. Only new surprises could reave that
vision from me; and presently, passing a large, white-painted,
wood-gate, I was startled to observe that although I was in a
wilderness, it was an extraordinarily well-ordered wilderness.
The trees along the path, ash and sycamore, I believed, stood at
like distances from one another and were spaced regularly
opposite. I seemed to be marching along a smooth avenue in a
park; the remoter trees, too, although they were obscure as
fleeing ghosts, appeared to flee away in serried ranks. The spaces
in the glades looked clear of underbrush. I was glad to note these
signs, if signs they were, of human tending, with their
suggestion of human nearness, for even my refreshened strength was
slipping away from me and the welts and strains of my body
were clamouring again.</p>

<p>Quicker than I had expected, I was out of the toy wilderness
into a clear space of thirty-odd yards (the dominant moon
showed me this), and Aidenn Water was roaming close beside
my path. A brook going to join the larger stream from some
hill-recess on my left was crossed by an old stone bridge with
urns at the ends of its stone balustrades, a ridiculously massive
structure for so insignificant a watercourse. But a few seconds
later I passed another object built with overplus of formality
and ostentation, a semi-rustic house which could have been no
more than a summer-house, quite unsuited for habitation but
freaked and loaded with statuary and gewgaws.</p>

<p>“The eighteenth century!” I murmured. “What nightmares
did they not have in the Age of Reason? Am I now to find a
geometrical mansion of Georgian brick?”</p>

<p>I had entered a new zone of drizzle and mist when I had my
first evidence of the house appertaining hereto. The fog thickened
almost to the density of a wall, and when the well-ordered
path ceased at the edge of the lawns, I blundered against a
tree trunk, one of three standing alone in gloom and grandeur
in the open space. I generously cursed the spirits, whose
exhalation, as every Welsh peasant used to know, the mist is. By a
flash of my torch I recognized the three tapering shapes as
horizontal cypresses, and at once I felt relief, for I was sure
that these none-too-hardy trees must be of a recent and venturesome
planting. I was becoming convinced that human lives were
not far from me.</p>

<p>A few steps more and I was standing on a pebble walk beneath
the shorter northern wall of a definitely up-to-date
structure. The stone may have been old stone, but it had been
smoothed off within a generation, and the ivy had evidently been
somewhat restricted in its rambling in order that the broad-spread
glass of this storey might not be effaced from the light.
Why all this glass? A conservatory? I stepped across the walk,
flashed my torch, peered in, saw a glimmering galaxy of flowers,
sniffed and detected a hint of their thick odour, was satisfied. A
conservatory it was, extending from end to end of this northern
wall, with unlit, wide-paned windows from end to end save
where a steep outer stair led up to a small roofless platform and
door in the first storey; and I perceived a vague second storey,
above which chimneys sprouted.</p>

<p>Now, I should not have lingered here more than a few seconds,
had not there burst forth a chill sound that actually took
me out of myself for a moment, a caterwauling from somewhere
behind me and further toward the mountain wall of the ravine.
It seemed impossible that such a desecration of silence could
proceed from a single throat. It was a sobbing cry full of hunger,
but there was positive anger and direness in it. It had a quality,
too, of immitigable anguish, as though all the hopelessness of
dumb beasts were its burden. Once the throbbing cry subsided
into a gruff growl, and then, strangely enough, was the first
time that I recognized its clamour as that of a cat. “But,” I
remembered thinking, “it must be a cat as big as a wolf.”
And while the last throes of the savage wailing echoed back
from the hill, I looked up to the gloomy heights of the mansion,
as if I expected each dark window to flare with inquiring light.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/map.jpg" alt="A map of the area surrounding
    Highglen House. Close to the house are some ruins and the Stables.
    A road leads from the stables, past the house, and then down the
    map. Off to the left is a grove of strawberry trees, in the middle
    of which sits a hard tennis court. At the top right corner of the
    map is a building labelled “Farm of the sisters Delambre”. The
    farm sits close to a fence, which runs across the map until it
    meets the river, labelled “Aidenn Water”. The river runs down the
    left side of the map, turning briefly towards the middle of the
    map where it crosses under the road. Between Highglen House and
    the farm is a footpath, halfway along which it passes a small
    structure labelled “18th Century Summer House”. A small brook
    branches off of Aidenn Water which crosses the footpath at a small
    bridge, and from there another footpath continues up the map,
    through a gate in the fence, and beyond.">
</figure>

<p>In puzzlement and lively eagerness to discover more about
this mansion, I turned to the right and followed the walk to the
corner of the conservatory, where it joined a drive that wound
out of the right-hand darkness. I discovered that the side of the
house extended a hundred feet or more parallel to the course
of Aidenn Water. Visible, too, on the broad lawn at four or
five rods’ distance from the house was a tall, two-legged thing,
fifty feet high by a rough judgment, an erection of twin towers
with a passageway above and between, the whole standing lonely,
dark and still.</p>

<p>The conservatory’s narrow side ended in the jutting of a
tower, quite black. Between this and the next tower, its
counterpart, I caught dim glimpses of modern french windows, a
pair of them, evidently belonging to the same large room. There
was a formal entrance between the second tower and the third,
but since it was unlit, I decided to go further in hopes of finding
the main portal. Yet I had a view of what was behind the door,
and again I paused, fascinated.</p>

<p>Inside the third tower, the projecting half of an octagon
studded with little windows, I saw a taper burning low in an
old candlestick fastened like a bracket on the wall, a thing of
fantastic crooks and curlicues. The light was blue and brittle,
for the wick was surfeited with grease. But I was able to see
three men in the panelled hallway, two of them standing, or
perhaps leaning, against the wall. Of these I perceived no more
than their dark featureless forms, and a marked stiffness in their
attitudes. On the opposite side of the hall from the candle, they
were too vague to be any more particularized than as human
forms. The third man, save for his little tuft of white hair, had
been no more than a smudge either.</p>

<p>For he was bent over, his back toward me, <em>and he was picking
the pockets of the other two men</em>! I can describe his actions in no
better way. They, seemingly stupefied, made no motion to
prevent!</p>

<p>I must say that the old, white-tufted fellow was not very
adroit at his work. I stood absolutely spell-bound while I
watched him paw about the clothing of the two others. The
candle guttered with special vehemence, and the pilferer turned
upward to it an anxious eye. Then he appeared to make a decision;
standing full length, he crossed to the candle and lifted
his lean fingers to snuff it. I was impressed by a sight of his
narrow brown face, vulturine in contour, with the tall, furrowed
brow of a student, the thin, pale lips of an ascetic, and
the broken-off jaw of a fighter. The expression was whimsical
and wily. The light glinted for an instant on a green eye, on
white smiling teeth, and on the diamond stud in his shirt-front.
Then the fingers smothered the feeble flame, and he was in the
darkness with those dazed ones I suspected were his victims.</p>

<p>And I hastened around the fourth tower, larger than the
rest, at the southern extremity of the mansion. What was I to
do? Had I in fact witnessed the induction to a serious crime?
Was it my duty to report what I had seen? It must depend on
circumstances; perhaps the old tufted sinner was the proprietor
himself. I must be cautious. I must be dissimulative.</p>

<p>Above all, I must not be surprised.</p>

<p>An electric chandelier sparkled in the large corner tower,
revealing it to be part of the sumptuous library of the mansion,
empty of persons. I found the entrance I sought in the middle
of the south end of the building. The crunching drive made a
great circle, leading to a square-arched, ivied entry. A barred
lamp above the vestibule faintly revealed the arms of the house
cut in stone at the apex of the arch, and surmounting this, as a
sort of crest, was the rude but unmistakable image of a cat’s
head. I dimly perceived a feline nose with faintest trace of
whisker running along it, and triangular ears. The mouth was
grinning, not pleasantly.</p>

<p>Here was matter for vast surprise, but I must not <em>be</em>
surprised!</p>

<p>I stepped underneath the arch, to the broad iron-bound
black-door. Another pale light revealed the knocker, an iron
piece in the shape of the paw of a cat. There was also the
button of an electric bell. I grasped the paw and struck twice.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the door opened. “Come in,” said a
voice. “You’ve been—”</p>

<p><em>I must not be surprised!</em> But I gaped, and gurgled, for all I
know.</p>

<p>The sturdy square-set fellow in evening dress who had opened
the door so suddenly and who now stood in the half-light was
staring at me, beginning to look a little <i>distrait</i>.</p>

<p>“Oh, so you’re not—” he commenced brusquely, and,
changing his tone, recommenced, “But <em>are</em> you, or aren’t—?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” I managed to gasp. “I’m not—I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>I had known nothing of Aidenn Vale or of the ruins,
mansions, or creatures in it. But I knew this man!</p>

<h2>IV. <br> The Bidding Feast</h2>

<p>“Pendleton!” I exclaimed, “the Honourable
Crofts Pendleton!”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“Hail, fellow well met! This <em>is</em> a lark!”</p>

<p>The man was nonplussed. It had always been, at least for me,
one of his chief charms when we were in the same college, the
haziness and obstruction of mind that were so queerly assorted
with his solidity of physique. Now, eight years between, he was
bulkier than ever and (I was willing to wager) yet more
detached from reality in his mental operations.</p>

<p>He was scratching his fine mane of hair now, irresolute. And
he really had reason to be confused while we confronted each
other in the dimly-lit porch. For I presented such a scotched
and scrambled appearance as never before, mould-mud-and-sweat-clotted,
unrecognizable no doubt even to my most accustomed
friends. Why should he not be startled when in this
gear and guise I greeted him with burbling cheer?</p>

<p>He looked so dumbly helpless that I had to laugh.</p>

<p>“Man, man, do you mean to say that you don’t remember me
by my voice?”</p>

<p>“Your voice?” repeated Pendleton. “Yes, it sounds
familiar” (he was lying), “but somehow I can’t—”</p>

<p>I kept chuckling, and he looked hurt; so I said, “Of course
you can’t. I’m Bannerlee, Alfred Bannerlee.”</p>

<p>The announcement drove him back a pace. “No!”</p>

<p>“Emphatically yes.”</p>

<p>He was studying me intently now, quite rapt. “But how on
earth did you find your way up the Vale? It must be full of
stinking fog down there in New Aidenn.”</p>

<p>“I came <em>down</em> the Vale!” I announced. “There’s a
thimbleful of mist up in the north, too.”</p>

<p>“<em>Down</em> the Vale! You say you came down the Vale!” Then
suddenly realization and recognition of me burst upon him for
the first time, and he reached for my hand and gave it a good
pumping, grasped my elbow, and took me inside. “My dear
man, my dear fellow, you must have had a sickening time.
Delighted to have you with us. By gad! How on earth did you
ever find this nook in the woods?”</p>

<p>“I’m an antiquarian, you know, a nomad. I might better ask
how you did the same,” I rejoined. “And, er, are you the
butler?”</p>

<p>“No. Of course not. I’m the host. Why, what do you mean?”
He stared at me with the old uncertainty.</p>

<p>“You answered my knock with remarkable alacrity.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was just at the door, going to open it anyhow. I was on
my way to my room when I heard you out there.” He gestured
toward the drive. “I imagined you’d want to be let right in.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Crofts, you didn’t know who I was.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I did. That is, I thought I did. Oh, there’s a fine
state of confusion here. You see, we’ve been waiting for Sir
Brooke Mortimer since before dinner. And as he’s not sent
word, we’re still waiting for him.”</p>

<p>“Oh?” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he.</p>

<p>We were standing just inside the hall, which contained some
of the finest screen panelling I have seen. I guessed, rightly,
that it was Henry VIII. work. A multitude of little heads
peered out from the wall beneath coats-of-arms, and the foliated
edges of the wood were as delicate as lace. There was a settle
standing on the left-hand side, where the ceiling sloped down
sharply, evidently beneath a winding stair.</p>

<p>Pendleton seemed struck by a sudden thought. “You’d like to
change, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“My dear man! If you’ll fit me out! I shall perish otherwise.
As I am, I’d rather not see people.”</p>

<p>“Well—would you mind waiting here a moment? I’ll fetch
Blenkinson. Not long. There’s a good fellow.”</p>

<p>He was gone, and I sat me down on the restful settle with
some gyrating thoughts to compose.</p>

<p>But before I had time to set one thought beside another, a
new man in evening dress came breezing nonchalantly past me
to the door, which he opened and peered out of, to close it in a
moment with a small shiver. It had grown chilly out-of-doors
during the latter hour of my odyssey. Turning, he beheld me in
my recess.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he exclaimed mildly. “So you <em>have</em> come. No news
of him?”</p>

<p>He was, I now think, one of the most deceptive-appearing
persons I have ever encountered, of a type emphatically British,
but the extreme of his type. He was the nonpareil for
unobtrusiveness and lack of distinction; without even the stamp of
vulgarity, he was ordinary and unnoticeable to the last degree.
I have never seen a man who appeared to possess so many
properties of a vacuum. His age, perhaps, was somewhere about the
third decade. He was of no particular height (actually about
five feet seven) or weight (about ten stone ten), and his face
was all that was commonplace. A pair of futilely brown moustaches
divided it into upper and lower portions, in the superior of
which pastel-grey eyes kept an unblinking but unobservant
watch; below, his mouth and jaw were neither strong nor
weak. His complexion was pale but not to excessive sallowness,
and his brownish hair, rather thin, was faintly flecked with
grey. His dinner coat fitted exceptionally well.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have come,” I answered, “but I’m not sure I’m the
‘you’ you mean.”</p>

<p>“Why, you’re Hughes, the keeper, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m just a friend of Pendleton’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so?”</p>

<p>He was not cloudy and remote like Crofts Pendleton; rather
I thought I detected even a trace of the sardonic in his tone, and
I must have flushed at the remembrance of my rough and
woebegone attire.</p>

<p>“I don’t look the part, I admit.”</p>

<p>“Well, no, you don’t.” He held out his hand with a cordiality
surprising to me. “Belvoir’s my name—Ted Belvoir. It’s
B-e-l-v-o-i-r, you know.”</p>

<p>“Bannerlee’s mine. B-a-n-n—”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I spelled mine out on account of these
Americans. They think it’s funny to pronounce it ‘Beaver!’ ”</p>

<p>“Americans!”</p>

<p>“Why, you must be quite a stranger here. Didn’t you
know—”</p>

<p>“I know nothing. I am indeed an utter stranger, save for
being acquainted with Pendleton. You see that I’m rather the
worse for wear; well, I’ve been running and scrambling and
climbing all over Aidenn Forest to-day, and to cap the climax
I fell into this Vale and blundered upon this house.”</p>

<p>“All over Aidenn Forest?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am an antiquary of sorts.”</p>

<p>“Now, that’s very interesting, very interesting. Why, you
may have—have you seen anyone?” There was a glimmer of
excitement in his pale eyes.</p>

<p>Now suddenly it occurred to me that reticence might be
useful in this mansion whereof I knew so little and that little
full of perplexity.</p>

<p>“Why, what sort of person?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a gentleman prowling at a loose end.”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” I assured him, “unless he was mightily
transmogrified.”</p>

<p>“Well, that delays us again.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the man you mean is, er, Sir Brooke Mortimer.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” His eyes widened. “Now, how did you know that?”</p>

<p>“Pendleton told me before he went to fetch the butler.”</p>

<p>“That’s the man, that’s the man. Irritating, isn’t it? Hughes
and some of the other servants have gone in search. That’s why
our host takes so long to get Blenkinson, who must be busy.”</p>

<p>“You don’t tell me the servants have gone out to scour for
him!”</p>

<p>“He’s such an irregular blighter, you know. May have tried
to walk it from New Aidenn or even from somewhere else on
the line. They’re going to telephone down when the station-master
comes for the evening train. You see, he wasn’t due on
any particular train, but they expected him to send word ahead.
So they’re in a pretty pass.”</p>

<p>“What’s the man look like?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a little, piddling sort of minnikin. Wearing a couple of
pairs of glasses, most likely, and sure to be smoking an offensive
cigar. Speaks with a lisp when he gets excited—sometimes when
he isn’t. You couldn’t have seen him?”</p>

<p>“No,” I avouched. “Neither to-day nor any other day.” I
had already resolved, by the by, to tell no stranger about the
men I had seen. I wanted to be believed.</p>

<p>I refrained from asking why Sir Brooke’s presence was so
necessary for the comfort of all, but my new acquaintance
evidently saw the question in my face, for he answered it in a
manner to provoke my curiosity yet further. “He’s going to
propose the health of the bride, y’know.”</p>

<p>A third personage came round from the other side of the
stairs, and the blood in my veins gave a little leap when I
recognized the white-haired man whose suspicious behaviour I
had overlooked in the dim room with the tower windows. His
gaze was inquiring, as if he had come to see whose the voices
were, and when he saw my unaccustomed face, he gave a cluck,
as if to say, “I know who <em>you</em> are,” and demanded peremptorily:</p>

<p>“Are you the missing idiot?”</p>

<p>I said, “Perhaps.”</p>

<p>His little dark eyes sparkled. “Then you’re not—no, I see
you’re not. You haven’t, by the way, seen a lost sheep of a
knight outside?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Somehow Belvoir had melted away upon the coming of this
gentleman; now the old fellow, with his eyes pursuing the other
down the hall out of my view, snapped, “So much the better.
We have at least one crazy man here already.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! What is his name?” I asked with much enjoyment,
expecting to hear Belvoir identified, for I judged that no love
was lost between these two.</p>

<p>“Cosgrove!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I haven’t heard of him, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will.”</p>

<p>He was gone!</p>

<p>I listened to his waning footsteps down the hall for only a
brace of seconds before I had made a hasty, rash decision. I
would see, before anyone else, what was the state of affairs
inside the room where I had witnessed this old fellow’s dubious
practices. I edged around the curve of the stair, saw him moving
briskly away at the other end of the wainscoted and carpeted
passage, which was quite broad enough to be called a good-sized
gallery. There were two doors on the right, four on the left
(counting one by the stair-foot, where the corridor broadened
almost into a room), and one away at the far end, which last
must lead into the conservatory. A collection of portraits, large
and small, hung over and between the doors, although, since
the hall was wholly enclosed by rooms, they must never be seen
save by artificial light.</p>

<p>By the time I had comprehended so much, the old gentleman
had disappeared through the farthest door at the left. An
entrance behind the stairs I judged to lead into the library where
the light was blazing, perhaps as a beacon for Sir Brooke. The
room I sought must lie beyond the door facing the stair-foot. I
felt like a burglarious person while I opened it and stole into
darkness, taking out my electric-torch. And the moment
afterward I felt like a fool.</p>

<p>The yellow cone of light played on walls hung with trophies
and weapons of every age and sort. I saw the old candle-bracket
by the window, and the closed doors leading to rooms
on each side, as well as to the open. Standing where the “men”
had been were two hollow suits of armour, complete in plate
and chain.</p>

<p>So the old codger’s only crime must have been a little harmless
fussing about. Still, why had he chosen near-darkness when
there was, as now I saw, an electric switch beside the door?
Perhaps the switch was out of order; I had not the courage to
try it and see. Almost, but not quite, I acquitted the
white-haired gentleman of evil design.</p>

<p>I lost no time in returning to my station in the hall. I was
on the settle, and had almost decided that Crofts Pendleton had
forgotten me when he appeared apologetically, with the butler,
carrying a loaded tray, at his heels.</p>

<p>“If it’s compatible with bathing, I got Blenkinson to put
some dishes together. Dinner’s just over.”</p>

<p>“My dear Crofts, you’re too thoughtful.”</p>

<p>“Very seldom, I assure you,” he smiled.</p>

<p>“Certainly, I’d like to break the edge of appetite, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go up to my room.”</p>

<p>Blenkinson, with impeccable whiskers, looked as if he might
be the Master of University College. With the tray, he followed
us up the circular stairs, whose well reached into the dim
heights of the second storey. A room on the right of the first
landing was Pendleton’s.</p>

<p>“Hullo, it’s dark! I expected Ludlow had come up. He
complained of feeling seedy.”</p>

<p>The long corridor of this floor, which I later found to lead
to the door of the landing of the outside stairs at the north end
of the building, was invisible until Pendleton touched a button
on the wall.</p>

<p>“Ludlow? Is he the tufted individual, hawk-like?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. Have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“We have conversed slightly. He’s downstairs.”</p>

<p>“He must be feeling better,” murmured Crofts. Yet somehow
I distrusted that his Lordship had suffered even a little twinge.</p>

<p>Now Blenkinson withdrew discreetly as a Dean, after examining
each dish on the tray and giving every cover an
approving caress.</p>

<p>“May I ask a question?”</p>

<p>“Blaze away.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t things a little out of order here, to-night? Or are
there no ladies present?”</p>

<p>“There are ladies, plenty of ’em. But what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why are the men prowling around the House? Where are
the ladies? Don’t they customarily leave the men at the board?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, usually.” There was a light in his eyes that caused
me to expect something quite illogical and characteristic. “But
here it’s the other way round.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Here the men leave the table to the ladies. It’s the local
custom.”</p>

<p>It had come, the sublimely ridiculous. But still—I ventured:
“Then most of your guests are Welsh folk?”</p>

<p>“Not one; all English and American. But ‘When in Rome,’
you know, Bannerlee. I like to pay tribute to the <i>mores</i> of the
place. That’s a word of Belvoir’s; you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>In anyone but Crofts Pendleton I should have held such deference
to the manners of the parish or the borough or the shire
to be a gesture of mock. But mockery was out of the question
in that face of perfect guilelessness. So innocent and susceptible
were those big features that I had a momentary impulse to tell
him that there appeared to be “goings-on” in the House. But
I forbore.</p>

<p>So, beginning to lay aside my reeking clothes, I asked him
the nature of the party, and if it were in celebration of a
particular occasion, and in so doing I met point-blank another
of his vague notions, disassociated from the working of any
ordinary mind.</p>

<p>“A very special occasion indeed,” he declared. “We are
having a wedding party—that is, there’s going to be a wedding
party; to-night it’s a Bidding Feast.”</p>

<p>“Bidding Feast?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Crofts, evincing much pleasure in his revelation.
“It accords with the folk custom. You look oddly. Haven’t you
heard of it?”</p>

<p>“Not sufficiently, I fear.”</p>

<p>“It’s very old, very old, to help the married-pair-to-be to set
up housekeeping.”</p>

<p>“Then I am amiss in not knowing something of it, having
turned desultory antiquarian since we were last together. Tell
me about it.”</p>

<p>He seemed shy and apologetic. “Of course we don’t go into
all of it—the donations of bread and cheese and sugar and such,
or promissory notes (they’ve been recognized as legal obligations
in the courts, you know). We haven’t had any of that, or selling
cakes and ale for the enrichment of the couple. These are
wealthy people. And we’ve dispensed with the ‘inviter.’ ”</p>

<p>“Oh, you have?” I asked ironically. “What, perchance, is
he?”</p>

<p>“A professional in the business exclusively. He tramps the
country for several days ahead and bids the householders with
a set of humorous doggerel verses, or printed ballad. I’ve
several works describing it all in the library downstairs. It used
to be a universal thing in Wales, but it’s almost a dead-letter
now.” He looked as if he were about to sigh.</p>

<p>“And you say that you’re reviving it for a couple who are
not Welsh?”</p>

<p>“Welsh? Of course they’re not Welsh. Paula Lebetwood’s an
American, and Sean Cosgrove—well, he’s an Irishman.”</p>

<p>“One hopes so. And how goes the Feast?”</p>

<p>“We’re being terribly festive! Under the circumstances, you
know. . . .”</p>

<p>Here was the maddest, one might say the most pitiful, of
Pendleton’s fancies. A Welsh Bidding Feast for setting up a
couple in housekeeping—only minus the Welsh folk, minus the
donations, minus the cakes and ale, minus the “inviter,” minus
about everything, in fact, except the good intentions of the host!
A ghost of a Bidding Feast.</p>

<p>“Surely, Crofts,” I remarked, “if you are trying to revive
the good old Welsh customs, you might suggest a bundling
party.”</p>

<p>He went red, but was too good-natured to take offence. “Nonsense,
man. Don’t mention it. Why, it’s an immoral thing.
Sermons used to be preached against it.”</p>

<p>“But under the circumstances!” I repeated his phrase.
“Morality is a question of local custom, isn’t it? The <i>mores</i>, you
know.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mores?</i> Oh, you sound like Belvoir, who’s been getting
everybody in a stew.” He overlooked his own introduction of
the word.</p>

<p>“Well, I shan’t propose it, my dear man. I know that I
should be mobbed, without a Welshman in the Vale to protect
me.”</p>

<p>A flicker of movement crossed his features, and his voice was
constrained, even grave. “Without a Welshman?—well, I
don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You’re aggrieved, Crofts. What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“This place is full of wild-eyed superstitions,” he declared,
beginning to pace the length of the room. “We have a few
Welsh servants—they keep the place up while it’s unoccupied—and
they’re agog with the Gwyllion and the Tylwyth Teg.
They’re stirring up the rest with tales of the haggish fairies and
dwarfs and goblins that seem to infect this locality.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I laughed, yet with a pinch of queerness in thinking
of the near-apparition who had occurred on the ledge-path, “as
long as nobody has met his own funeral and the dames and peers
of elfin-land keep outside the walls—”</p>

<p>“But that’s just it!” he cried vexatiously. “There’s <em>been</em> an
invasion. The women have made me put all their best jewellery
in the strong-box, and still they’re fretting.”</p>

<p>I paused in the act of drying my back. “You don’t mean—”</p>

<p>“The worst visitant of all is in our midst, and unless we dispose
of him our nerves will be in tatters!” Then he lapsed into
sudden contrition for his vehemence. “Of course I’m not such
a fool as to believe any of it.”</p>

<p>“The supernatural, you mean?”</p>

<p>“That’s why I said I’m not so sure we haven’t a Welshman
in our midst. He must be at the bottom of it all. Confound it,
somebody must be.”</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean by ‘he’?”</p>

<p>“Parson Lolly,” answered Pendleton, with slightly bated
breath, and I remember that I was impressed into silence for
a moment.</p>

<p>“<em>Parson</em> Lolly?”</p>

<p>“So he is called.”</p>

<p>“And who may the Parson be?”</p>

<p>“A legend, just a damned legend.”</p>

<p>“And a Welshman too?”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” he exclaimed with an eager gesture. “Don’t you
see it must be so, or else there’s hell let loose in this valley? It
must be a man, must be, must be! Only—” He checked
himself.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“No man can do the things Parson Lolly is said to do.”</p>

<p>I made a complete break in my toilet and scrutinized my
friend, who was visibly shaken. He said, “It’s no use trying to
describe how it feels to be a host in the midst of such a
hullabaloo. It’s the very devil. And I can’t <em>do</em> anything to stop it.
Helplessness is a terrible thing.”</p>

<p>“Now tell me some of this nonsense,” I urged. “And first of
all, why ‘Parson’? It’s creepy.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” he agreed. “That designation adds oddness,
sinister, too, to the whole portrait of him.”</p>

<p>“What else is there in his portrait?”</p>

<p>“He’s old, several hundred years old at the most conservative
estimate of the servants. His business is general mischief and
bedevilment and, I surmise, thievery.”</p>

<p>“What does he look like?”</p>

<p>“He has the face of a demon, red with hell-fire, and streaked
with smoke. He has the likeness of a man otherwise, but he
wears a great flowing robe of black; there’s where the ‘Parson’
part comes in, I suppose. The robe is vaster than any prelate’s
of earth, though there again you have the sinister touch. He—he
flies in it, Bannerlee, like an enormous crow! He’s been seen
flying away over the Bach Hill.”</p>

<p>“How far is Bach Hill from here?”</p>

<p>“About two miles.”</p>

<p>I resumed my dressing, and simulated a laugh, for it would
not do to seem too much impressed with this fol-de-rol.
Pendleton maintained his appearance of dead seriousness.</p>

<p>“I wonder if there’s anything else. Oh, yes—his voice.”</p>

<p>“Voice?” My question must have been sharp.</p>

<p>“It’s a young voice and an old voice in one. He’s been heard,
Bannerlee.” Pendleton licked his lips. “I’ve heard him myself.”</p>

<p>“You must leave this, Crofts,” I admonished, dimly aware
that I was cribbing from literature. “You’re letting your
imagination make sport of you, of course; but, tell me, what’s been
the spring of all your troubles? What’s actually happened here?”</p>

<p>His mood had shifted. “No, let’s change the subject. This is
no way to receive a guest, with omens and warnings.”</p>

<p>“But, good heavens, you only make it worse when you stop
at the warnings. I want to hear some of the facts.”</p>

<p>“You really do?”</p>

<p>“This is absurd. Of course I do.”</p>

<p>But Crofts’ mind was then in an unwilling state as regarded
retailing the misdeeds of the Parson. He became sketchy. At first
there had been annoyances among the servants, the overturning
of pots and skillets, the displacement of articles, some so
thoroughly removed that they never would be found. For the
past forty-eight hours these trifles had been throwing the kitchen
into an uproar, but one more serious thing had occurred the
previous evening in the presence of the guests who had already
arrived. All Pendleton would tell me of this outrage was that
it had to do with the smashing of the conservatory window, and
that then the voice of the Parson had been heard by everyone.</p>

<p>“It makes me feel sometimes, for a minute or two, that there
may be something in it,” he muttered finally. “Why isn’t it
possible that someone has found a method of flying with a
minimum of mechanical aid? It will happen sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“When I see him taking off, I’ll believe—not otherwise.”</p>

<p>“That’s the sensible thing to say—very sensible.”</p>

<p>Now in the course of this long conversation I had disencumbered
myself of my damp-heavy explorer’s gear, had cavorted in
the bath between the rooms of Pendleton and his wife, had
donned his dressing-gown and shaved with his razor, had
covered myself with one of his old business suits, now “uncomfortably
snug” for his frame, but flappingly loose for mine. The
food I had reserved until after the bath; although the things
were now cool, I took half a cupful of coffee and sampled the
leg of a duck. I resolved to confide one thing to Pendleton now;
perhaps it would bring him some relief. So, swiftly explaining
my movements in Aidenn Forest that day, I related my adventures
with the man on the ledge-path, and hinted that he might
be at the root of the mischief.</p>

<p>“What time was that?”</p>

<p>“Over two hours ago, I suppose.”</p>

<p>He shook his head, wistfully. “No, I wish it was as simple
as you suggest. But the Parson was making trouble among the
servants only an hour before you came.”</p>

<p>I thought of the menagerie-keeper, yet somehow he didn’t
fit into this situation.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Crofts. Still, you mustn’t let such antics disturb
you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, I won’t,” he promised, but I thought his protest
a little feverish.</p>

<p>While we went downstairs I gave him the best imitation I
could of the stranger’s cry on the ledge-path, and asked him if
he believed it was Welsh.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, with the gravity of conviction, “no, that’s
certainly not Welsh.”</p>

<p>Bless his simple heart! I believe he knows no more Cumraeg
than I.</p>

<p>We moved along the galley-passage, and nighed the third
left-hand entrance.</p>

<p>Now, just as we were about to enter, while we heard the
voices of festivity inside, he turned to me suddenly.</p>

<p>“I’m sending the boy to your village beyond the hills
to-morrow morning—whatever-its-name-is—for your things.
You’re to be one of us, of course.”</p>

<p>“My dear Crofts, I hate to intrude.”</p>

<p>“No intrusion. And there are other equal strangers among
us. Will you stay on for a couple of days?”</p>

<p>“I’d be delighted.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll announce you as one of us.”</p>

<p>We joined the Bidding Feast.</p>

<p>I motioned my host to precede me into the midst of the party.
Now it so happened that we entered with none to observe us, for
this door opened beneath an old musicians’ gallery.</p>

<p>We had no sooner entered this shady spot than I placed my
hand on Pendleton’s sleeve and put finger to lips, and stood to
take in the scene in silence. The head of a cat, with ears
singularly set back, made a rest for the hand at the pillared foot of
the winding balustrade to the gallery. It had given me a moment’s
shock at first, but now I set my fingers along that smooth
nose and peered covertly from the concealment of the little
staircase. The Bidding Feast, save for floral and evergreen
festoons about the Hall, had all the look of two tables of ordinary
auction bridge.</p>

<p>But I hardly did more than give a secret glance at the guests
before surveying the extent and features of the Hall itself.
Flat-ceilinged, its wooden roof supported by braced thirty-foot
timbers, a room regular in its right-angularity, it nevertheless gave
the impression of spaciousness. It was two storeys in height, full
forty feet in length, and obviously of great age, perhaps a
bulwark of war, for its ashlar masonry was undisguised by arras,
woodwork, or plaster. Somehow, save for the chimney-piece in
the wall beyond which the conservatory lay, a fireplace which
was massive without being cumbrous, the appointments of the
room seemed to me inept. All the Tudor furniture was gone,
and in its stead was a collection of mahogany and walnut pieces
from the lion-mask period—and later—looking frail and prettified
in that ancient stronghold of defence. The woven-backed
chairs, the spindly animal-legs of the tables with their claw-feet,
the spider’s web marqueterie decorations, were to my mind
strongly out of keeping. The waxed floor was in part covered
by old English “Turky” carpets. Altogether a medley of
anachronisms was the Hall of the Moth, but its walls a-frown
and towering chimney-place lent nevertheless a thrill of
antique grandeur.</p>

<p>Two of the eight card-players I recognized, of course, Lord
Ludlow and Belvoir, who were opposed to each other at the
nearer table, where the deal had just been made. Lord Ludlow,
who was facing me, lifted his cards from the table, arching his
brows above the pince-nez which now clung to his sharp-wedged
nose. Satisfaction gleamed from all quarters of his countenance.</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> haven’t the right kind of face for cards,” I thought;
then a notion made me mutter, “Or, I wonder?” The old
dissembler!</p>

<p>I was impressed by the vague familiarity of the back of Lord
Ludlow’s partner, and guessed her to be the hostess of the
Bidding Feast. I had known Alberta Pendleton in the early days,
and had seen that stately back preceding me up the aisle at her
wedding. It had taken on added dignity, if anything, in the
intervening years, and I expected, rightly, that her delicate
beauty (Pendleton had been ungodly lucky) would have ripened
into greater loveliness.</p>

<p>Belvoir, on her right, was opposite a woman I intuitively
knew must be his wife, for she might have been his widow. It
was not only that she looked older than she was, and gave that
impression, for she was gowned in black relieved by grey, and
that her cheek was pale, having a worn softness, or that her
composed voice, rather full and sweet, seemed full of twilight
memories; she had the half-experienced, half-expectant air
which bereft females wear. And indeed I supposed it could
hardly be otherwise for her, married as she was to a man who
seemed without a trace of colour, without a morsel of flesh to
him, or a drop of blood, the acme of innocuousness.</p>

<p>At the far table three men were playing with one woman,
whose back was turned to me. Facing her, and me, sat a
bright-eyed, youngish fellow with short black hair, a face almost
crimson-red, and on his right and left respectively a
dandified-looking chap with waxed moustaches, and a good solid
individual of immobile swarthy countenance, the image of a
substantial, dependable Englishman. This ponderous person was
dealing with a regular, unhurried motion that recalled to me the
grinding of the mills of God.</p>

<p>“A pretty kettle of fish!” I murmured to myself, and added
to Crofts, “A variegated lot, old fellow! So many different
tempers and purposeful minds reduced to the same dead level by the
permutations of fifty-two pasteboard slips. Saddening, Crofts,
saddening.”</p>

<p>“All intimates, one way or another,” he whispered. “Good
friends, mind you, but you’ll find them fighting half the time.”</p>

<p>“They certainly look engrossed in the game.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but that’s a pretence. They keep up a very brave front,
but any trifling disturbance would set them wild.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, man, there’s something foul and fearful in this
damned Vale. I half regret—well, come on. You’ve got to meet
them sometime. They’ve all heard about you.”</p>

<h2>V. <br> Kingmaker</h2>

<p>Forthwith commenced that three-legged race I
have already described, in whose zigzag course I was presented
to all these people in about two minutes.</p>

<p>While my mind was still in a haze, a small thing caught my
eye and made me give a much larger thing a rapid, cursory, and
at the same time careful survey. The small thing was still
another image of a cat’s head, this one in profile with jaws apart
and bared teeth, the head forming a heraldic badge tucked into
one spandril of the Hall fire-arch. The renewed sight of this
insistent emblem had a bad effect on me. The leering head at
the outer door, the sleek head at the foot of the balustrade, and
this vindictive head brought the sharp, nerve-tearing cry of
the outer darkness into my ears again.</p>

<p>“Crofts”—I must have spoken with asperity—“why the
devil didn’t your family choose some holier badge than a
damned cat’s head, with nothing funny or Cheshire-ish about
it?”</p>

<p>“My family? Not my family.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not—”</p>

<p>“Lord, no. Dirty thing, isn’t it, that one? But not mine.
Bought this place a couple of years ago. Look there, for a
primitive genealogical sign.”</p>

<p>I thought at first he was pointing to the badge and I leaned
to examine it at closer quarters. The spandrils of the fire-arch
had the usual long crinkled leaves of the early Tudors; on one
lay the royal rose, on the other the badge of the head.</p>

<p>“No, no, not that—the mantel-tree itself.”</p>

<p>Pendleton tapped the very old and thoroughly blackened
beam of oak resting on the upraised hands and the heads of a
pair of grotesque knee-bent dwarfs in lieu of corbels. And while
I stared at it, somewhat at a loss to grasp his meaning, he
passed his hand along its outer surface, saying, “If you can’t
see, feel.”</p>

<p>This mantel-tree, obviously the original, though forming
more than merely an incipient shelf, was unusually low for the
period (if I knew anything of such) and I had to lean a bit to
get my eyes flush to it. My fingers felt the slight roughness of
lettering, and I deciphered, in French characters, the
smoke-stained names “Arthur Kay” and “Biatryx Kay,” which
Pendleton assured me I read correctly.</p>

<p>“None of your ilk, you say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Quite the most ancient family in these parts. Here
before the House itself, before the castle.”</p>

<p>“That ruin up the Vale?”</p>

<p>“No, I mean the castle this house is remnant of. That
other—up the Vale—that was the Kays’ too.”</p>

<p>“And the head of the cat?”</p>

<p>He shrugged. “You ought to know more of these things than
I, you gravedigger. It’s part of their coat-of-arms. Look.”</p>

<p>I had already taken in the entire fireplace. It was in harmony
with the grey walls. The over-mantel, like the interior of the
unlit chimney-place itself, was composed of large stone blocks,
very ancient, and the beam on which the names were cut formed
a canopy from which it receded to the summit of the lofty chamber.
The half-obliterate vestiges of what must have been a cross
were visible in the centre of this curtain of rock, and on either
side a shield with unrecognizable blurs for quarters. Only where
Pendleton pointed I could see what might have been a feline
profile.</p>

<p>As my host remarked, the subject of bearings lay more aptly
in my special province than in his (which was, I remember, the
excellence of sodium and its compounds). I was about to launch
into a necessarily brief statement of what this device might
signify, when Blenkinson entered and murmured something
inaudible to his master.</p>

<p>“People at New Aidenn,” remarked Pendleton with slight
ellipsis. “Be back at once.” This last was a promise, not an
imperative.</p>

<p>He followed the servant out, and my exegesis was, as it
happened, for ever postponed. Gilbert Maryvale, whose partner,
Oxford, had made the declaration, seeing me solitary, rose from
his chair with the peculiar lightness that was so unexpected and
came to my side.</p>

<p>He looked at me with inquiry in his very dark eyes while
he settled himself against the over-mantel. “Word from Sir
Brooke?”</p>

<p>“I believe Pendleton’s gone to ’phone the station-master at
New Aidenn. We’ll know, doubtless, in a minute or two.”</p>

<p>“Yes, doubtless.”</p>

<p>I thought I perceived a greater interest striving to suppress
itself in him; I looked at him sharply. “Just why, Mr.
Maryvale, are we all agog over this gentleman’s absence?”</p>

<p>He was abashed for an instant, then, cocked an eye in humorous
confession, and spoke low. “Caught, I suppose. Well, Mr.
Bannerlee, I don’t think that, barring an exception or
two”—he hitched a shoulder toward the nearer table where Mrs.
Bartholomew was deliberating whether to play the ace or not—“I
don’t think we <em>are</em> particularly agog as a whole. One may
have one reason, one another, but mine is that I believe Sir
Brooke Mortimer is a good deal different from what he seems.
And you may be sure that I’d not be telling you that if I
weren’t sure that his real purpose will be revealed—”</p>

<p>He said more, but I did not take in the sense of it. Eve
Bartholomew, I noticed, played the ace, which was immediately
trumped by Oxford; but that was a trifle. What had taken me
out of mind for a moment was the striking similarity of his
words to the thought in my own brain, that the people in Aidenn
Vale were other than they seemed. This, great as was my
attraction to it, was scarcely a topic to be pursued with my
acquaintance of a few minutes, and my next contribution to talk
turned the subject.</p>

<p>“I was about to ask Pendleton a question; may I victimize
you?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly—if I can—”</p>

<p>I lowered my voice to half its volume. “I am sure that you
can. This, according to our host, is a genuine old Welsh Bidding
Feast. But as far as I could discover, most of the attributes
are missing, and especially the most essential one of all.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“The bride in prospect. I am quite certain she is not, er, here.”</p>

<p>He laughed with his eyes, throwing back his head quite
gleefully. “You may be sure she’s not. Of course, our good
Cosgrove’s American betrothed—did Pendleton tell you she’s
American?—isn’t in sight just now. The fact is, Miss
Mertoun—Oxford’s her cousin—has been headachy all evening, and Miss
Lebetwood has been staying with her since she went to her
room.”</p>

<p>Crofts Pendleton had returned; he was beside us on the
heels of my latest speech, and his face revealed excitement
somewhat chastened by alarm.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell ’em all at once?”</p>

<p>“But what’s to tell?” asked Maryvale.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t on the night train, but the station-keeper thinks
someone like him came up in the afternoon. How he—supposing
it was he—missed getting in the motor—there Wheeler was
waiting for him especially—unless he wanted the
walk—he <em>would</em>—well, shall I?”</p>

<p>“It will raise nobody’s spirits,” said Maryvale. “But suppose
you do.”</p>

<p>“Hughes and the men are back from below the bridge,” muttered
Crofts. “They’ve seen nothing of him either.” He clapped
his hands for attention.</p>

<p>I kept my eyes on Crofts while he made his statement, but
out of the tail of one I noticed that Maryvale was scanning the
inhabitants of the Hall, as if to catch the effect upon each. The
effect was strong. When my eye took in the room, everyone had
laid down his cards and was looking at the blank countenance
across the table. There was hardly a word spoken; no one asked
a question. Then Eve Bartholomew took up her hand once more.</p>

<p>“Sir Brooke is a sensible man,” she announced. “He has
probably returned to New Aidenn to put up for the night. And
there are men looking for him if he is lost. Let’s go on playing.”</p>

<p>By her determination, which at the time I divined to be only
a courageous sham, she drew the widely surmising minds in the
room back to a focus on bridge. A few minutes later Maryvale,
with a courteous but irresistible gesture, waved Pendleton into
his place at the table opposite Charlton Oxford, and my host
picked up the newly-dealt cards with perturbed countenance.
Maryvale rested a foot on the fire-dogs—they were of much
later date than the fireplace itself, their brass enriched with blue
and white enamel—and took from the mantel-shelf a long-stemmed
clay pipe, a veritable churchwarden. This he carefully
packed with a shaggy sort of tobacco and smoked with deep-drawn
pleasure, having offered me an excellent cigar, which I
declined in memory and anticipation of flight from bulls.</p>

<p>Presently, since Eve Bartholomew had given the fumes several
looks askance, and sniffed, Maryvale with a smile led me
to the nearest of two entrances of french windows, opened it,
and stepped outside. I followed, descending a step or two to the
drive beyond which lay the lawn. The air was mild again and
the fog had become only a mystery in the trees.</p>

<p>“Too chilly for you?”</p>

<p>“By no means.”</p>

<p>“We’ll stroll.”</p>

<p>At that moment we were beside the little jutting tower between
the Hall of the Moth and the glassed conservatory, with
a small rockery just across the drive. I noted that the scent
of flowers at that spot was remarkably strong, almost as the
heady reek of the interior must be. I asked Maryvale if he did
not notice it too.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. But that’s because there’s no glass in that window.
They’re burning some oil-heating business inside until the
glazier comes.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s happened?”</p>

<p>“You’ve not heard?”</p>

<p>“I think Crofts—he wasn’t at all explicit.”</p>

<p>“Nor could he be. It was only a matter of a crash of a
splintering window, and a shout by a most hollow and bewildering
voice. Then, I must admit, there were other shouts from some
of us, and one or two of the ladies were not above screaming.
And nothing was discovered save the fragments of glass.”</p>

<p>“What did the voice seem to say?”</p>

<p>“It was clear enough. It shouted some rigmarole about
Parson Lolly. ‘Parson Lolly’s here,’ or ‘Look out for Parson
Lolly,’ or something of the kind.”</p>

<p>“What do you make of it? It worries Crofts severely.”</p>

<p>“Do you wonder? No, I don’t profess to make anything of it
myself. We must wait until we have more evidence.”</p>

<p>“Which may be most unpleasant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as for being afraid . . .”</p>

<p>We paused, I remember, by one of the large french windows
looking into the Hall of the Moth. At the table nearest us
Cosgrove carefully noted down the score. He picked up the pack,
shuffled deliberately, dealt. The cards flew bewilderingly from
his hand like a flock of humming-birds released from a cage;
they swirled and gleamed in the light. Yet Cosgrove’s arms
were motionless; only his right hand and wrist moved as swift
as the eye could conveniently follow.</p>

<p>“Cosgrove,” murmured Maryvale; “what a man!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>My companion’s surprise was thoroughly ingenuous. “You
don’t know about Sean Cosgrove?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about any Irishman.”</p>

<p>“Irishman or not, he’s a rarity—a sort of hardness next to
positive stolidity, yet with plenty of <i>savoir faire</i>—caution in
thought and preparation, and then a sure swiftness like that
dealing of the cards; add to it a consecration to an idea so
whimsical and quaint that heaven must laugh, and heaven must
speed him.”</p>

<p>“What idea may that be?”</p>

<p>“It’s one of those secrets everyone knows—Ireland redeemed.”</p>

<p>My “oh” was certainly disappointed.</p>

<p>Maryvale looked for some time at the red face of him before
he chose to enlighten me further. “Many wild young Irishmen
have burned and blazed for Ireland free, but never one I’ve
known had the genius of imagination of this man.” He added
in a low-toned parenthesis, “Barring the Marquess of Killarney,
I’ve no doubt he’s the wealthiest Irishman in the realm.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough distinction for one Hibernian.”</p>

<p>“Seldom known in his race, surely. And he saves his money,
looking always to the gleam of his great goal.”</p>

<p>“Well enough, Mr. Maryvale—but you speak as if he had
some special vision.”</p>

<p>“A Free State is nothing compared to the bright morning in
mind.”</p>

<p>“Ah, an anarchist!”</p>

<p>Maryvale chuckled. “That was certainly an unlucky dive of
logic, my friend. No, Mr. Bannerlee, Sean Cosgrove aspires to
restore the ancient dynasties of Munster and Leinster!”</p>

<p>“But—well, how will he find the lines? They’re extinct,
aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“I should hesitate to say categorically where Cosgrove is
planning to discover them.”</p>

<p>“But how will he set about it?”</p>

<p>“Well, if I tell you baldly, you’ll think he’s utterly mad.
He’s going to advertise in the <i>Times</i>.”</p>

<p>A vast vacuum of seconds must have gone by, while I looked
again intently at the huge face so solemn over its slips of
pasteboard, before I ventured, “And what do you think of him
yourself, then?”</p>

<p>“Let me explain what I meant when I said that Cosgrove
will advertise in the <i>Times</i> to find the true rulers of Munster
and Leinster. He will not advertise there alone; he will put the
inquiry in every little rag and sheet. He will send men among
the peasants on the land to ask. He will receive answers, will
he not, Mr. Bannerlee?”</p>

<p>“Of every sort.”</p>

<p>“Of every sort, as you say. The genealogist will ridicule,
the republican will sneer or snarl, the crank will present his
ready-made conclusions, the peasant will tell the tale his
grandmother’s grandmother crooned to her and she to him. And Sean
Cosgrove will receive every answer for the sake of the good
that may be in it. He is ready to examine every contention of
the genealogist, to sift the fables rigorously, to get at the root
of every wild story, to criticize every legend—and in the end
he will find his man, or find his truth! Let us go in.”</p>

<p>We reopened the french windows, entered the Hall of the
Moth.</p>

<p>I looked at him, who had so suddenly, yet so unaffectedly,
made almost an intimate of me in the brief hour of acquaintance,
tried to appraise the pent brows and the fugitive, almost
wistful eyes of Gilbert Maryvale, the “complete man of
business.” Those eyes, what were they seeking, or what had they
discovered? They saw deeps, I knew, soundings surely unsuspected
by these more or less ordinary people, by that old vulture
with white plumage, Ludlow—or Belvoir the nonentity—or,
certainly, this fancy man Charlton Oxford—or our unimaginative
host, Crofts Pendleton—or Sean Cosgrove himself, who
from Maryvale’s account must represent the quintessence of
insurgency and holy tradition.</p>

<p>These “ordinary people,” I had called them. But were they,
any of them, ordinary? My total impression of that company
at the Bidding Feast had become one of masks and shadows.
Such obvious contradiction as seemed to exist in the case of
Maryvale and such duplicity as Ludlow’s might have their
subtler likenesses in everyone. Mrs. Belvoir, with her melodious
voice, might be a volcano which had never gone up in flame and
ruin; this dapper Charlton Oxford might be a leading light
of the Society for the Cherishing of Atheism. Crofts Pendleton
had assured me that their air of studious interest while rapt in
the complexities of cards was a dissembling of fear, but I
wondered if it might not be a dissembling of something else
as well, something which I could not then grasp intuitively.
But I felt its existence, just as a man in a pitch-dark room may
be, they say, aware of another presence.</p>

<p>Maryvale, catching me look first at him, then at the absorbed
contestants, drew a mistaken deduction.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Bannerlee, no sign of any of them wanting to give
me my place back again. There’s a riveting fascination in cards
if you’re keyed right.” I believe he looked a bit ashamed of his
cross-bred metaphor. “One of the many forms in which chance
plays pranks upon us. All, all thralled.”</p>

<p>“Some more and some less, however.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, but my point was that no one escapes the
lure. Even the unlikeliest—”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cosgrove, that would be, I have—”</p>

<p>“I think not, I really am sure not. Oh, no.”</p>

<p>“What? You don’t mean his Lordship?”</p>

<p>Maryvale took his pipe in his hand, smiling, waved it.
“You do not know us, Mr. Bannerlee. We are really quite a
surprising company, we friends of Cosgrove, and his, er,
enemies. Now who, beside the respected Mr. Charlton Oxford
here, seems to you to personify most thoroughly the spirit of
conformity, the one cut out most neatly for a player of auction
bridge?”</p>

<p>I needed not to hesitate one whit, but with a nudge indicated
Belvoir. “He seems made to fit into any background.”</p>

<p>Maryvale laughed long and with absolute silence. “Yes, yes,”
he whispered, “a family man, I grant you, with legitimate
children, a householder in suburbia—so far so good. That’s
irony <i>in excelso</i>. But for deep down conformity of spirit, like the
thousand and one of his neighbours in Golders Green, ye gods!
Why, man, he’s the most radical wight in England—a stick of
dynamite!”</p>

<p>“He!”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you read his ‘Bypaths’?”</p>

<p>“His! Good God!”</p>

<p>Then from the farther table came a cackle from Ludlow:
“Well, I say it <em>is</em> so! . . . Saint Paul knew as much psychology
as any of your puffed-up pedagogues.”</p>

<p>Alberta Pendleton (who was his partner) said promptly,
“Did you play the deuce?” Our hostess is more tactful than her
husband.</p>

<p>Belvoir gave a thin Italian sort of snicker. “He’s trying to,”
he said.</p>

<p>I just made out the low, luscious voice of Mrs. Belvoir:
“Ted, that wasn’t good. Half a crown, please.”</p>

<p>“The family penalty for a pun,” explained Maryvale.</p>

<p>Ludlow gave a sudden sneeze, a whooping big sneeze, which
must have disturbed the cards on the table. “I beg—” he said,
and sneezed again.</p>

<p>My face being turned toward Maryvale, and Ludlow’s back
being toward me, I had no more than an imperfect glimpse
out of the tail of my eye at what happened next. Our noble
friend drew his handkerchief out of his breast-pocket with a bit
of a flourish, and something white and smaller came out along
with it. At that precise instant Ludlow was preoccupied with
a third sneeze which took him unawares and made his plumed
head bob down to the green board. There was consternation at
his table, amusement at the other, but I was the only one who
saw the object fly off to the left, poise for the cleaving of an
instant in flight, and glide and swoop gracefully down to the
floor beside the long-case clock in the corner. There it lay, a
slightly crumpled slip of notepaper, scrawled upon.</p>

<p>I gave some small exclamation, crossed in front of Maryvale,
picked up the morsel. It was certainly not my intention
to scrutinize the writing, but it was impossible in the act
of recovery not to see some words. All that made the least
imprint in my consciousness were the two concluding lines:</p>

<blockquote class="document">

  <p>“. . . you leave it in the mail—you know where; I’ll
  come and get it.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not even the signature gave me any impression; but it, I must
confess, looked like an intentional enigma.</p>

<p>A step or two across the floor would have taken me and
the slip to the discomposed Ludlow, but in my way was a
large reddish hand, attached to a long arm, and the arm
hung on the shoulder of an Irishman whose naturally red
face was filling with unaccustomed blood.</p>

<p>“Mine, sir,” said the bridegroom-to-be.</p>

<p>I shook my head. “No, Mr. Cosgrove, you must be
mistaken. I saw—”</p>

<p>“No doubt. Mine, I said.”</p>

<p>“But I saw it come out of the pocket of Lord Ludlow.”</p>

<p>“No doubt.” Cosgrove swung about in his chair with a ruddy
scowl. “And I’ll trouble his Lordship to explain how a piece
of my private correspondence arrived in his pocket, and will he
please tell me what use he thought to make of it?”</p>

<p>Our minds play us pranks. The quarrel itself should have
engrossed me, but an absurd irrelevant detail about Cosgrove
seized my attention. This was the first time that I had seen
the back of his head. His black hair, I have stated, was short
cut, and at the rear the recent clipping had left a broad streak
of white between his splay ears, so that a person seeing him
from behind for the first time, far from supposing him the
wealthiest bachelor in Ireland, might take him for a yokel just
come from his potato patch, rawly scissored for the fair, to
complete with other yokels for the favour of rustic beauties.</p>

<p>Then my glance shifted to Lord Ludlow, who also had
swung about in his chair, stiff and upright, his small bright
green eyes sparkling, his face full of indignation, like an
affronted gerfalcon’s.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir? I have no interest in your
correspondence, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Leave your pretences, shame on you, sir!” said Cosgrove
(to whom I had in impotence surrendered the slip). “This
is a private communication. I repeat, what presumption—”</p>

<p>“You’re mad,” scoffed Lord Ludlow. “I know nothing about
your communications. I don’t carry them about—”</p>

<p>Quite half-wittedly I interjected a hasty, “But my dear
Ludlow, I saw it fall when your handkerchief—”</p>

<p>This was mere idiocy, diverting the wrath of the god to
my own shoulders. The thin man turned spryly upon me. “If
you will kindly confine yourself to your own business, Mr.
Bannerlee, without excursions into the fantastic.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bannerlee is right, I have no doubt,” asserted Sean
Cosgrove with ponderous emphasis; “and he is prying into no
one’s business when he tells the lawful truth.”</p>

<p>“Fiddle-dee-dee!” cackled Ludlow.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Explicit!</em> Here, with the hurly-burly of the quarrel is
completed the exposition; what admired disorder ensued in the
next fifteen minutes I described at the outset of my half-the-night’s
scribbling.<a href="#note2" id="noteref2">¹</a>
What has it meant? What does it portend?
I am sure now that the intangible feeling impressed upon me
in the Hall was one of hostility, not the sort divulged by
semi-secret looks and half-heard imprecations, but a congeries of
criss-crossed feuds hidden completely by the thick veneer of
social amenity.</p>

<p>Well! sleep we must in spite of thunder. I have written as
often I used to, feverishly, with absorption, but never with
such a theme! What will to-morrow bring? What shall I have
to relate to-morrow midnight? Nothing dull, I hope; I trust
nothing grievous.</p>

<p>(Eve Bartholomew, whom I thought I heard prowling an
hour ago, left a slip of paper under the door: “Money! I’ve
known Sir Brooke to forget it before.”</p>

<p>Poor devil of a woman?)</p>

<h2>VI. <br> Strain</h2>

<p class="diarydate">October 3. 9.15 P.M.</p>

<p>I awoke, late in the morning, of course, very
much refreshed. For a moment or two I was puzzled by my
situation; then the tenseness and terror of the preceding night
stung me. I knew that brooding over those wild events would
lead to no good—of this and other matters I had already made
up my mind. I kicked off the bedclothes and ventured out of my
door. It was a minute or two past ten, and on my secret march
in last night’s borrowed dressing-robe down to Pendleton’s
room for a bath, I found no sign of any other guest.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, in the dinner-room across the corridor
from the Hall of the Moth, I sought breakfast. On the
threshold, his back toward me, I found Ludlow vehement,
making warlike gestures at someone inside.</p>

<p>He looked unnaturally thin and bent, Ludlow, attired in a
suit of cottage tweed, a smoky grey, a thing surely inherited
from some plethoric uncle, for it hung on his Lordship like
a bag and at the same time was too short in particulars. His
trousers were certainly not intended to show all that length
of woollen sock, and his wrists shot out from his sleeves like
a conjurer’s whenever, as now, he straightened his arms. His
Oxford collar, cut off too soon, exposed a lean craning neck.</p>

<p>Belvoir was seated at the table. He was on the point of
remarking in his blandest voice:</p>

<p>“And you know, my dear Ludlow, the notion of obscenity
is certainly modern.”</p>

<p>“No such thing,” sputtered Lord Ludlow. “Your opinions
are atrocious, sir, and your books are vile. You should be boiled
in oil for your opinions, sir—and for your books you should,
er, er—be parboiled!”</p>

<p>“And you, my good sir, should be embalmed,” rejoined
Belvoir with equanimity. “You <em>are</em> embalmed, by Jove! A good
job, too. That will explain everything.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir!”</p>

<p>“Not at all. My good sir, have you ever descended to
fundamentals from that altitude of sublime cerebration that you
seem to be soaring in whenever I expound my lowly beliefs?”</p>

<p>“Fundamentals? What do you mean by fundamentals?”</p>

<p>“I mean facts.”</p>

<p>“You mean a perversion of the facts, sir!”</p>

<p>Belvoir had caught sight of my grinning face over Ludlow’s
shoulder, and for my benefit, I believe, he carried on a
spirited rejoinder. “My books, upon which you have delivered
so restrained a stricture, are little more than depositories of
facts, my good sir. When I assert that modesty is a purely
conventional matter, I am not spinning a yarn from an arm-chair.
When I remark that modern marriage—all marriage—is the
outcome of hardened tribal customs, I am not foining in
intellectual darkness. When I comment on the different conceptions
of chastity, instancing the preparation for marriage of
Babylonian girls in the temples of the priests—”</p>

<p>Ludlow had been standing still as death during these words,
but I could see that his cleaver-like brownish cheek had been
taking on a very amiable purple hue. The mention of Babylon
fired him.</p>

<p>“Babylon! Filth! Pah!”</p>

<p>“Quite so, if you are viciously entangled in the nets of your
own particular hidebound, Tory—”</p>

<p>“You’re a fool, sir, and the sooner you—”</p>

<p>“But how beautiful to the Babylonian woman—”</p>

<p>“Rubbish! In the first place, you haven’t any—”</p>

<p>“Even you, Ludlow, if you had happened to be a priest in
Baby—”</p>

<p>“Outrageous, sir! What right—”</p>

<p>“Why will a Brahmin wash—”</p>

<p>“I am not a Brahmin either, or a—”</p>

<p>“Or take the case of murder. With us it is a crime, but
in—”</p>

<p>“Poppycock! Would you do a murder, sir, to show your
immunity to so-called custom?”</p>

<p>“I’m too kind-hearted,” murmured Belvoir.</p>

<p>“And yet you recommend us to throw overboard everything
we have saved from the past—to cast convention to the
winds—to wallow in a sty of the senses—to debauch—”</p>

<p>After a few purple seconds, like a puny Jeremiah, lifting
spindle arms out of his sleeves while he raised his fists, he
turned and stalked forth in a billow of smoke-grey tweed,
kicking a porridge-bowl along the floor. Beholding me, he
snapped “Good morning” while he went past.</p>

<p>“Lord Ludlow doesn’t stomach new ideas very readily. His
digestion was formed during the supremacy of the late
lamented V.R.”</p>

<p>Belvoir spoke from the floor, wherefrom he smilingly
recovered the porridge-bowl. I then saw that other dishes, and
silver, lay scattered.</p>

<p>The “stick of dynamite” explained, “The good Ludlow <em>will</em>
jump incontinent to his feet when he wants to bully someone,
regardless of whether his tray’s on his lap or not. He <em>will</em> eat
his breakfast off a tray.”</p>

<p>“Good lord!”</p>

<p>“Oh, small harm. I did not press my argument until he had
emptied every dish. As you see, neither ham nor egg hath left
a stain.”</p>

<p>I helped him recover the <i>disiecta membra</i>. While we collected
the crockery from the carpet, Belvoir murmured, “Poor
Ludlow! Too many spinning-mills—I’m afraid some of them
are going on in his brain.”</p>

<p>“Spinning-mills!”</p>

<p>“Yes, didn’t you know? Our noble friend is chairman of
a good few businesses in cloth—from Ulster to the Outer
Hebrides.”</p>

<p>“But really, Mr. Belvoir, I’m surprised to find you carrying
on any academic controversy this morning.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” His features held a vague look of trouble.</p>

<p>I had set about loading a goodly plate at the sideboard.
“Well, it strikes me that you were having a row about the
wrong thing.”</p>

<p>“The wrong thing?”</p>

<p>“Gad, man, hasn’t anything happened here to set tongues
wagging, that you must bicker with the noble Lord about
folkways and the comparative conceptions of chastity?”</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t mean—”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, is everyone in the House as indifferent as you
two? Am I the only one who remembers there was a massacre
last night?”</p>

<p>“Well,” hesitated he, “I suppose that those signs and
evidences—at night—”</p>

<p>“You mean, now it’s good broad morning sunlight,
everyone has calmed?”</p>

<p>“Considerably, Mr. Bannerlee. Even Miss Mertoun, who
saw that horror, wanted to go out of doors this morning, but
Miss Lebetwood forbade it.”</p>

<p>“Miss Mertoun!” I looked up astonished from sausage and
bacon and steaming coffee.</p>

<p>“Last night, you know, we supposed that she would have
to remain in bed half a week. But a blue morning sky
re-creates the world, and people. Besides, a couple of the most
painful enigmas are considerably lightened. What do you lack?
Milk?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You won’t find any, I’m afraid. The milkman’s man—we’ve
had it over the ’phone—is in the throes of a nervous
breakdown.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t Crofts keep a cow of his own?”</p>

<p>“He does, but the beast has failed ignobly. Well, as I was
saying, last evening’s troubles are mostly dissipated.”</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“Sir Brooke, for one. Pendleton has had a note from him
in the morning post.”</p>

<p>“He’s not coming?”</p>

<p>“Well, what should you say? The note consisted of three
words: ‘Wait for me.’ What should you say?”</p>

<p>“What does Pendleton say?”</p>

<p>Belvoir laughed. “Poor chap, he’s almost off his chump still,
as you may guess. Governing a household threatened with
theft and no one knows what else is out of his line. He’s in high
dudgeon over it—wants to know how long he’s supposed to
wait, why he should be expected to wait at all, and so
forth. <em>He</em>, if you like, hasn’t forgotten last night.”</p>

<p>“What I can’t see is, why this gentleman’s absence should
paralyze the proceedings.”</p>

<p>Belvoir winked. “We can’t have the Feast proper unless the
bride’s health is drunk, and Sir Brooke is assigned to
proposing the toast.”</p>

<p>A few seconds went by while I absorbed this statement.
“No one else could propose it, of course?”</p>

<p>Belvoir grinned. “Well, opinions differ. Crofts says
anybody can, but Cosgrove solemnly insists that no one
else <em>shall</em>!”</p>

<p>“What difference—?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to ask Cosgrove; but he won’t tell you the
answer, the real answer, that is. He’s put his foot down,
though. No, Sir Brooke means no Bidding Feast; that’s
flat.”</p>

<p>“How long do you suppose the festivities can be postponed?”</p>

<p>“A day, says Pendleton. Then if he had his way, the
marriage would take place, Brooke or no.”</p>

<p>“The marriage! With all that ugliness and horror
unexplained?”</p>

<p>Belvoir shrugged. “What would you have? The fact is that
the blood is not so significant as we thought. Pendleton would
have sent for the police to-day, I dare say, in spite of his stand
last night, but the source of the blood has been found, or rather
missed.”</p>

<p>“The source?”</p>

<p>“A possible or probable source. A sucking-pig with all necessary
qualifications is gone from the sties. Pendleton seems to
believe that a poacher may have slaughtered it, or that someone
has indulged in a ritualistic blood orgy, or that—but we
can’t make out what he thinks, if he knows himself. Come outside,
Mr. Bannerlee, and see for yourself how the exhibits have
lost their grisliness in daylight.”</p>

<p>We met Pendleton at the foot of the stairs. His greeting to
me was effusive yet a trifle strained. He had been going up to
call me; hadn’t expected that after my long—here he looked
at Belvoir, bethought himself, and stammered—well, he hadn’t
expected me to be up so soon. The boy Toby, he said, had at
nine o’clock been sent on his bicycle through New Aidenn to
the ineffable village, to fetch my bag from the inn, and
incidentally to re-inquire about the reported appearance of Sir
Brooke at New Aidenn station. Most of the guests, however,
believed the identification had been mistaken. As a fact, Sir
Brooke was quite irresponsible enough to stay overnight and
not ’phone. But since the message— Were we going out? He’d
come, too.</p>

<p>On the lawn beyond the mighty gate-house—and herefrom
in the daytime we could see the narrow glitter of Aidenn Water
beyond the tennis-court some distance up the bank—on the
lawn the blood-pool, now a dry clot, and the hatchet with
helve and blade both stained, were fenced off with guards of
chicken-wire.</p>

<p>“And don’t you think these are serious testimony?”</p>

<p>“To what? to what?” Pendleton inquired. “What can we
make of Parson—”</p>

<p>“You have swallowed this Parson Lolly, hook, line, and
sinker. Now I—”</p>

<p>“You and Oxford weren’t so chirpy last evening,” observed
our host.</p>

<p>I was indignant. “Well! Did I seem to be in the same
condition of nerves—”</p>

<p>“You saw the same thing.”</p>

<p>“But, Crofts, man, it surely can be explained somehow
without—”</p>

<p>He was impatient. “Yes, of course, everything can be
explained. Things have been happening, oh, quite explainable
things, all of them—only not one of them <em>has</em> been explained.
But what I object to is giving them an explanation that’s pure
conjecture. You evidently think there’s been murder here.
You seem to believe that’s human blood. How do you know it
isn’t pig’s blood?”</p>

<p>“Why not try to get someone here who can tell?”</p>

<p>“Someone <em>is</em> coming,” snapped Pendleton.</p>

<p>“Oh, you have sent—”</p>

<p>“No; more guests arriving, that’s all. Late comers.”</p>

<p>“Like Sir Brooke?”</p>

<p>“No, not like Sir Brooke. Sir Brooke promised to come
yesterday; these weren’t expected until to-day.”</p>

<p>“And one of them will be able to tell—”</p>

<p>“Doctor Aire should be able to tell,” said Pendleton wearily.
“Come on over to the court, and let’s forget this.”</p>

<p>I acceded gladly enough. Belvoir begged off on the score
of writing letters, and Cosgrove, that moment hailing us from
the library window, came through the armoury door in baggy
knickers and an Irish edition of a sportsman’s coat (black and
astonishingly high in the collar).</p>

<p>While Cosgrove, Pendleton, and I moved along northward
and surveyed the meagre walls of the glazed conservatory, we
could tell from the mere vestiges that that large room and the
storey of three bed-chambers ranged above it were later
engraftings to the house. The tinting of the stones was bolder,
undarkened, and brick had been used to some extent north of the
tower that marked the limit of the original wall.</p>

<p>An odd thing, that conservatory window fractured by the
Parson in his latest escapade. Brilliant purple clematis framed
the lower expanses of conservatory glass. Beneath a small
birch-tree opposite the great burst-in window we paused for a
moment in order that I might see the damaged section. Again the
blooms within sent out a heady breath. The gap in the glass
was extremely irregular in shape, a good five feet in its tallest
dimension, half that in its widest. To-day, said Pendleton, the
glazier from New Aidenn, already come for a preliminary
examination, would bring his paraphernalia and close up the place.</p>

<p>“That’s quite an opening unprotected.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no fear,” said Crofts, “the door from the conservatory
into the corridor had been double-locked and bolted from the
corridor side. Always is, anyhow, unless someone wants to go
in to make music.”</p>

<p>“Make music?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the piano’s there, you know.”</p>

<p>“And how do you account for the shape of the smash? It
looks as if someone walking on air had stepped through the
glass.”</p>

<p>“Someone flying?” muttered Cosgrove, running his finger
along the edge of the broken pane.</p>

<p>Pendleton made a movement of annoyance. “Oh, I don’t try
to explain it. I leave that to you, sleuth-hound. That
description of yours sounds very probable to me.”</p>

<p>“Our poor, dear host,” I murmured pityingly. “Forgive me
for harping on the ungrateful chord of mystery.”</p>

<p>From beyond the thick-clumped shrubs to the north and
toward Aidenn Water came a staccato of handclapping and a
few bright tones of voices in the fresh, vibrant sunlight. The
sounds reminded Pendleton of our objective.</p>

<p>“Come along to the tennis. That must be Paula playing.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a bit late in the year for tennis?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but Paula would play it in Iceland.”</p>

<p>“She is good then, I take it?”</p>

<p>“Very good. She’d give you a run, Bannerlee.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, I’m no use any more. What sort of court have
you, Crofts?”</p>

<p>“Hard. Too much rain here for anything else.”</p>

<p>While we went our way, I was all alert for signs of the
billowing and swelling marauder of last night, and I thought
ruefully how a fictional detective finds clues even in bent
grass-blades. I kept my eyes wide. We crossed the lawn and passed
near the cypress trees where the black-robed creature had
disappeared. Surreptitiously I looked for footprints; nothing
was distinguishable.</p>

<p>Before reaching the track leading to the pretentious bridge
over the tributary stream, we swung left through the bushes
and soon came to a knoll full of scaly-red, twisted strawberry
trees.</p>

<p>“These are aliens in England,” explained Cosgrove to me,
while we wound our way upward through the plantation. “But
in my country they are natives. I like nothing better than to
loiter among them; they almost make me think I am in old
Muckross again. There is one reason why I like your
Highglen estate, friend Crofts.”</p>

<p>We found a pleasant clearing there, where we could lie,
having a view both of the lawns and of the tennis. The
strawberry trees extend thickly beyond the knoll and around the
court, which is only a few yards away from Aidenn Water
where it comes straight down the middle of the Vale before
making quite a detour toward the western escarpment. A
doubles match was in progress, and the knot of spectators was
too intent on the exchanges to notice us.</p>

<p>“There’s Paula,” indicated Crofts. “Look at that shot!
She’s master of us all with the racquet.”</p>

<p>A white-skirted player had given a leap, a <i>whang</i> was to
be heard even from our vantage-point, and another patter of
applause. I thought the Irishman looked satisfied.</p>

<p>“I approve of the excellence of women in games,” he said.</p>

<p>We reclined at our ease and had a good view of Miss
Lebetwood and her partner grinding down their opponents.
Cosgrove, it developed, had never played tennis, nor did he any
other game—now. In his “youth,” he told us, he had been a
good Rugger player, I think he called himself a “dangerous
partisan”; “murderous” I thought might be the fitter word
while I gazed at his countenance full of heavy seriousness and
wondered when this young man considered his “youth” to have
ended.</p>

<p>He swept his arm toward the enclosure where the players
darted and skipped. “As for this juvenile pastime, my part in
it has been confined to holding the fish-net.”</p>

<p>I gave an astonished “Fish-net!”</p>

<p>“Yes, on the stream bank.”</p>

<p>Crofts Pendleton rolled over so that he might address me.
“We lose a good few balls here.”</p>

<p>“Well, these tangled strawberry trees might swallow any
number.”</p>

<p>“There’s more in it than that. It seems almost uncanny
sometimes how many are never recovered.”</p>

<p>Cosgrove said, “The number of missing balls is
extraordinary.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and wild shots often go into Aidenn Water. We
usually have someone on the bank with the net to recapture
them floating down!”</p>

<p>“That must be a grateful task.”</p>

<p>“It is like all other labours of love,” rejoined Crofts, “a joy
to the doer, a wonder to the Philistine.”</p>

<p>I looked sharply at my friend; little nippy speeches like that
were not like him.</p>

<p>Our talk drifted away from the games. I mentioned that
ruin farther up the Vale, which I was eager to see by daylight.
Cosgrove had some wild tale about it which he told with
sonorous impressiveness—only, while I watched the lithe leaps
of Paula Lebetwood and witnessed the accuracy of her shots,
the gist of the history escaped me. At this moment all I can
recall of it is that the word “treachery” kept coming in. Even
if I was distracted from appreciation, Cosgrove seemed to
derive a pure pleasure from hearing himself pour forth. But
Crofts Pendleton did not dote on the tale; instead this account,
doubtless half fact, half legend, seemed to remind him of
present broils.</p>

<p>During an exchange of courts, I let my gaze alight on
Mynydd Tarw, that northern hill above the ruin, whereon
Aidenn Water begins at Shepherd’s Well. My glance roved
down the western line of hills, Black Mixen, Great Rhos,
Esgair Nantau, and Vron Hill, the last directly opposite us
across the Water.</p>

<p>“Do you see it?” Crofts said suddenly.</p>

<p>“What?” I asked, rolling over with a start.</p>

<p>“The tumulus on Vron Hill. Some old josser lying up there
with a ton of stones on his chest.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t see it.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I. Funny thing about it, it lies just over the
shoulder of the Hill from where we are. At sunset, though, it
looks quite grand up there, if you can see it.”</p>

<p>“Somehow I’ve noticed that,” I remarked gravely.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Things look better if you can see them.”</p>

<p>Crofts brushed aside my feeble attempt at leg-pulling.
“Seriously, though, Bannerlee, you should have a try at it this
evening—from your window, or from outside on the balcony. I’m
no good at old stones and that kind of thing, but I do get a
thrill when I think of that codger up there sleeping it off.
He chose a breezy place to wait for Judgment.”</p>

<p>“I will have a look,” I promised. “I can’t see, though, why
this antique gentleman selected that Hill in preference to any
one of several others hereabout.” I indicated with my arm.
“Why, that one, for instance, or that one, must be a couple
of hundred feet higher. Don’t you think so?” I put it to
Cosgrove, but he hesitated to commit himself, and Crofts said
that I had better ask Miss Lebetwood, if I were too lazy
to consult an ordnance map.</p>

<p>“She’s hot stuff at all that, really—very useful.”</p>

<p>I saw Cosgrove give his head a doleful wag.</p>

<p>“Her brother—American army officer—killed,” explained
our host. “Before he sailed for France she made him teach
her all he knew, apparently. She and he would pore over the
maps and plans together, I understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” came in Cosgrove with his voice like the great slow
tramp of oxen, “she has too many of these unwomanly things
in her head, I misdoubt. Photography—”</p>

<p>“Topography, you mean,” contradicted Crofts, surprised out
of his jaded condition into smothered laughter by the
Irishman’s blunder. “Topography, not photography.”</p>

<p>“I said photography, and I’ll stick to it,” replied Cosgrove
with never a smile. “And topography as well. Do you call
them fit studies for a woman?”</p>

<p>“They, and others like them, are the very things that make
you ache for her,” said Pendleton with what I considered
remarkable penetration. “They form part of the wonder of her,
the quality that makes it hard for you to realize just what
a prize you’ve captured. Come man, frankly, what would you
give to have her for your wife two days from now if she didn’t
have intellect as well as a treasury of golden hair and
emotions which permit a strange susceptibility to such as you?”</p>

<p>I looked curiously at Cosgrove, to see how he would take the
challenge. He took it stolidly, with never a sign on his rufous
countenance; only after a while his eyebrows lifted sharply, as
if he considered the possibility of truth in his friend’s words.</p>

<p>For my part, I soon was too absorbed in the dart and dip
of the tennis ball to notice much more of the talk. Pendleton
kept trying to tell me more about Miss Lebetwood, how she
loved climbing, how on earlier visits she had taken the
unpromising lad Toby in hand and uncovered surprising
intelligence in him. It all had something to do with photography—or
was it topography?—no matter. She had even brought down
some apparatus—or was it maps?—and given it to him. Cosgrove
kept still now, while our host rambled on, evidently
glad of any topic he could talk of without unpleasant
associations.</p>

<p>Suddenly the game was over, and everyone concerned trooped
toward the House. Pendleton was hailed by somebody and had
to join the returning party, though I think he would have been
glad to remain out of sight of his country home just then. I
was well content to stay with Cosgrove, for the man rather
fascinated me; his mind seemed to be full of admirable
inconsistencies.</p>

<p>We strolled southward where Aidenn Water makes that
monstrous sweep to the west beyond the towered gate, and
further where the stream swings sharply eastward again under
the very toes of the bounding hills. There stood the bridge,
a crossing of one arch: ill-hewn, moss-grown moor stone with
a two-foot parapet, quite immeasurably old and quite quaint,
with an immemorial ash-tree overlooking it from this side. The
water stole peacefully underneath. I expressed surprise that it
would bear any considerable weight, and Cosgrove with an
air of commenting on the irrelevant remarked that he did
not suppose it was ever expected to bear any greater weight
than Pendleton’s motor or a tradesman’s team and wagon.</p>

<p>“Look at it, I say, look at it. They build no bridges like
that to-day.”</p>

<p>We remained several minutes there beside the water-crossing,
which was indeed picturesque, then turned toward the
half-hidden House in some haste, for the sky had gradually been
overcast and now there was a premonition of showers in the
nip of the wind.</p>

<p>We hastened through the main portal of the House, beneath
the stone head of the cat, just in time to escape a flicker
and dash of rain.</p>

<p>There at the foot of the stair-well was Pendleton again,
with a long, sour face.</p>

<p>I suppressed a desire to laugh.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“That damned, diseased pest!”</p>

<p>“What! Not the Parson once more!”</p>

<p>Cosgrove cannoned an incredulous “No!”</p>

<p>With the suddenness of a conjurer our host thrust before
our noses a second cardboard placard scrawled across with
uncouth printing mingled of capitals and small letters, now
composing a message of more sinister purport:</p>

<blockquote class="placard">

  <p>LooK ouT FOR PARSON LOLLY He MEAns
  BUSINeSS</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“Ah, yes,” I murmured with perhaps a little too much surface
effort at nonchalance. “Parson Lolly means business now.
He was only trifling last night.”</p>

<p>“He was interrupted last night—be sure of that,” intoned
Cosgrove.</p>

<p>“Damned lucky for us, then.”</p>

<p>Pendleton was unsteady with righteous embarrassment and
rage when Cosgrove interrogated him. “Where was this thing
found?—who found it?—when—”</p>

<p>“Harmony—one of the housemaids—the vixen,” snapped
Pendleton, and seemed unable to make headway.</p>

<p>“Why is the good Harmony held in such opprobrium?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>“I swear she’s lying—the minx—or she put it there
herself.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In your room, Sean, lying in the middle of the floor.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Pendleton had been saving that item for rather
a stiff jolt at the last. I happened to be looking at Cosgrove
and saw his eyebrows jerk upward prodigiously, as if they
were going to fly off his forehead, and the eyes beneath them
bulged and stared like glass.</p>

<p>“In my room? When was this?”</p>

<p>“She just came down from doing the beds—says she found
it there not five minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“Hem,” said Cosgrove, his features settling into a study.</p>

<p>“Come, come,” urged Pendleton, making a nervous movement
of impatience. “Tell us—when were you in your room
last?”</p>

<p>“A little after nine, I think,” answered Cosgrove, solemnly
scratching his black-thatched head behind the left ear, his look
scowling and intent upon the floor, his brow cleft by one heavy
wrinkle. “I saw the boy riding the bicycle out of the barn;
that would be nine, you said. I heard Lord Ludlow quarrelling
with the man Soames for bringing him the wrong color of
towel, a quarter of an hour later—fully. And I came out in
the corridor in time to see Soames disappear down the stair.”</p>

<p>“After a quarter past nine,” said Pendleton. “That leaves
over two hours—unless Harmony—”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have been there and you not see it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“In the centre of the floor? Mr. Bannerlee!”</p>

<p>“Are you implying that it was left there last night?”</p>

<p>“I withdraw the suggestion, Crofts,” I said, “although—”</p>

<p>“There are enough ‘if’s’ and ‘although’s’ in this to—to
stock a political editor,” grumbled our host.</p>

<p>“Has the placard any mark, any peculiarity—”</p>

<p>“For identification, you mean?” Pendleton turned the cardboard
over between his fingers, dubiously. “It’s like last
night’s—cut round the edges with scissors or a knife—might have
been part of the bottom of a box of sweets.” His voice was
despairing. “I suppose enough board for twenty foul things like
this comes into this house every week. And in all Wales—”</p>

<p>“Our search—supposing we go about a search—will hardly
be as broad as that,” said Cosgrove, and I was struck, as many
times before, by the lack of lightness in his voice. He meant just
that: that if the placard were investigated, the whole country
need not be drawn into the matter.</p>

<p>Our host turned to the Irishman: “Search won’t do any
good; that’s certain sure. But I’ll have the servants up this
afternoon. (Bannerlee, you be with me while I question ’em
and tell me what you think of their candour—you’ve no
prejudices, you know.) Sean, what do you think of it? Are you
alarmed?”</p>

<p>Cosgrove laughed contemptuously.</p>

<p>“But it’s directed to you this time.”</p>

<p>“It’s casual, casual. What could anyone—what could this
meddler have against me?”</p>

<p>“It was left in your room.”</p>

<p>“By chance,” insisted Cosgrove. “There could have been no
malice toward me in it.”</p>

<p>“But, by gad, what shall I tell the people here?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—and swear the woman Harmony to whisper never
a word.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, I’ve sworn her on the Bible until she was
blue-scared, the jade. But this thing?”</p>

<p>Cosgrove reached out and took the placard. He tore it
across, placed the pieces together and tore it again, and
repeatedly, and handed the bits back to Crofts.</p>

<p>“Make a small fire in the Hall.”</p>

<p>It impressed me as a really brave thing, and I believe that
Crofts felt the same admiration for him who dismissed such a
message, apparently out of the air, from man or superman or
sub-man.</p>

<p>“Here goes, then.”</p>

<p>“Has the boy come back with my bag?”</p>

<p>“Not for at least another hour, I’m afraid. He has a long
hilly road to ride—down through New Aidenn and all the
way around by the south skirts of Aidenn Forest.”</p>

<p>“Sir Brooke?”</p>

<p>“Not a nail of him. But the others have come.”</p>

<p>I echoed, “Others? Guests?”</p>

<p>“Doctor Aire and the two young, very young Americans.”</p>

<p>“And what says the Doctor to the blood on the lawn?”
asked Cosgrove.</p>

<p>“He took some of it up for microscopy. He can tell if it’s
probably human or not. He’s more than a little interested.”</p>

<p>We had entered the Hall of the Moth from the portrait
corridor, and through the plenteous windows saw a swift rain
pouring down.</p>

<p>“The evidence is getting wet.”</p>

<p>“Canvas spread over,” Crofts assured us. “And <em>this</em>
evidence now gets carbonized.”</p>

<p>We watched the fragments of cardboard smoulder, flare,
and become consumed in the fireplace where raindrops spattered
down the chimney, until only ashes were left, and a tiny
spire of smoke. Cosgrove disintegrated the ash with the poker.</p>

<p>“<em>That’s</em> a blessing,” said Crofts, taking out his watch.
“Luncheon-bell in ten minutes. Between now and then I shall
smoke not less than three cigarettes.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch07">

<h2>VII. <br> Court of Inquiry</h2>

<p>We ate beneath a sprinkling of electric lights and my
mind was glum with foreboding.</p>

<p>As usual, Ludlow made himself manifest. His sneer in a
shrill staccato was apparently directed against Doctor Stephen
Aire, a new arrival. Him I had not yet met, the table being
already seated when I came down from revising my toilet in
my lofty bed-chamber.</p>

<p>“—and the wrigglings and windings of the new psychology,
the <em>new</em> psychology, forsooth!”</p>

<p>A diatribe by Lord Ludlow I already considered to be in
the nature of a treat, and I leaned forward to see how the
challenge would be received by Doctor Aire, who was seated
at the same side of the table as I. All that was visible of him,
of course, was head and shoulders, extraordinarily broad and
square shoulders in rough purplish tweed, and a shocking small
and yellowy-looking head with tight-stretched skin, a balt spot
like a tonsure in a ring of sparse grey hair, and short
pepper-and-salt moustache. His eyes (I could see, for he sat only two
away from me) were small and bright and seemed to be
twinkling amusement.</p>

<p>“The new psychology, sir—”</p>

<p>“No, Ludlow,” clicked the doctor, his thin bloodless lips
curved sharply upward at the ends, “not the <em>new</em> psychology, of
course. <em>Why, Saint Paul knew as much psychology as anyone
living to-day!</em>”</p>

<p>At this iteration of his own words of the night before his
Lordship stared, swallowed, and collapsed into silence. A small
but delighted squeak produced by a morsel of a girl at the
other end gave away the secret of pre-arrangement, and a
laugh murmured about the table.</p>

<p>Now, I was not the only one who particularly noticed this
very young lady, “Lib” (short for Liberty!) Dale. While I
took in her appearance, I became almost intuitively aware of
another gaze making an angle with mine. Cosgrove was staring
at her, so enigmatically that I removed my glance from
her to him, just as she turned her blue eyes upon me with a
quick little movement of her head. Vastly <em>interested</em>, totally
engrossed, seemed Sean Cosgrove just then, but the quality of
his interest was untellable. In the judgment of a second, I
guessed his to be a look of, almost, aversion; he seemed
fascinated, yet scandalized. Then the fleeting expression was gone,
and he leaned back, turned to his neighbour.</p>

<p>Now I was aware that another beside myself was intent on
Cosgrove!</p>

<p>Pendleton sat in sole occupancy of the head of the board.
The ends of the table, however, were broad enough to seat two
of our numerous party, and Alberta Pendleton shared the
foot with a youth of sturdy appearance. Bob Cullen completed
the American group among us. His alert eyes had the queer
habit of blinking owlishly at whiles; he possessed also a pug
nose, a good, clean-cut mouth, and a jaw meatless and
determined. Between the mode of his smooth black hair and that of
“Lib” Dale’s there was, as far as I could see, little to tell. He
was very shy. His contributions to conversation, such as I had
happened to overheard, had been “That’s right,” and “Yes,
Ma’am,” addressed with schoolboy gruffness to Alberta
Pendleton, who smiled on him with aunt-like approbation. He has
attended for a year, I understand, one of the great American
universities.</p>

<p>He, then, was staring at Cosgrove, while the Irishman’s
regard rested in trouble on the boyish features of “Lib” Dale.
The American youth’s face went unwontedly white, and his
eyes, now wide open, glared. There was nothing puzzled in his
expression, only resentment and a vague awe, as if he knew he
confronted a better man than he.</p>

<p>Then Cosgrove shifted, and the drama of three seconds,
which has taken three pages to describe, was over.</p>

<p>Chairs scraped; we rose to our several heights. “Lib” and
Bob were distinctly the shortest among us, and Doctor Aire
was not much taller. But the physician, standing up, was the
strangest creature in the room—a clockwork man.</p>

<p>That broad-shouldered body in the tweed-suiting was boiler-shaped,
and the long, gaunt arms and short, stodgy legs, seemed
casual appendages joined at convenient locations. Atop this
mechanical contrivance his head stuck like an absurd plaster
carving on a pedestal. I could not but feel a queer,
half-repugnant sensation when, on my being introduced to him,
his yellowy, almost Chinese-looking face was close to mine,
and I saw only the blue shadows where his eyes had retreated
and the narrow-lipped mouth nigh to white in its
bloodlessness.</p>

<p>I looked about to be presented to the pair of young
Americans; they had already skipped out of the room.</p>

<p>“Since it’s still raining and we’re tired of the things we’ve
been doing anyhow, we’re going to get Doctor Aire to tell us
about the old magic in this neighbourhood,” said Alberta.</p>

<p>“That will be frightfully jolly,” I remarked, surprised at
the bizarre field of knowledge evidently studied by the
physician.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it will be, as you say, ‘frightfully jolly,’ ”
remarked Doctor Aire, with his smile at the very ends of his
mouth. “I’m not sure the subject—in view of events—”</p>

<p>“Why not the new magic instead?” asked Crofts.</p>

<p>Doctor Aire turned his head sharply; I almost expected to
hear a ratchet click. “What’s that?”</p>

<p>“The stuff in old Watts’ attic, I mean. We’ve found a
conjurer’s outfit there, Doctor. Why not give ’em a show? That
performance of yours at Coventry was as good as any
professional’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll settle that in the Hall,” smiled Alberta. “Come
along, Mr. Bannerlee.”</p>

<p>“But I want him here,” objected Crofts. “We’re going to
examine the servants.”</p>

<p>“You really want me?” I exclaimed. “But I don’t know
your servants—haven’t seen but four of ’em yet.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” he explained. “I want someone to be here
who can get a good unprejudiced impression of how they
behave.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I can assist—”</p>

<p>“But have you asked Mr. Bannerlee if he <em>wants</em> to stay
and listen to the silly—”</p>

<p>Crofts besought me. “Oh, come, Bannerlee, you know as
much as Doctor Aire does about magic—you with your
antiquities.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, it is one of the fields where I have done
very little spading, but—”</p>

<p>“There, see,” smiled Alberta.</p>

<p>“But I was going to say that this interrogation of yours
sounds particularly interesting. I’ll stay, if you don’t mind,
Alberta.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” laughed Pendleton’s good-natured wife.
“I only tried to protect you. Crofts is a fearfully long-winded
inquisitor.”</p>

<p>“I think I am the best judge—” began he, but the door
closed, cutting short his speech and her laugh.</p>

<p>There were thirteen servants in the room when the tale
was made. The dessert dishes from luncheon had not been
removed. Crofts sat at the head of the board; I was
inconspicuous in the curtained recess of the window where Belvoir
had sat at breakfast-time.</p>

<p>From this vantage-point I had my first glimpse of the grounds
immediately east of the House. I saw an unexpected lawn with
lovely flower-patches extending to the kitchen-gardens. On
both sides were topless and toppled walls much gnawed by
time, clearly a portion of the ancient, much vaster edifice of
which Highglen House is a survival. A group of well-preserved
square stone buildings about thirty yards away on my right
were, of course, the stables and garage.</p>

<p>The half-dozen women-servants and two elderly men-servants,
besides the magisterial Blenkinson, were in chairs
along the inner side of the room, while the other men stood
with marked differences of composure before the screens that
guarded the entrance to the pantries and the kitchen. The
number of “below-stairs” folk would have been much greater,
of course, had not the Pendletons requested their guests not to
bring personal servants. Thus we men all valeted ourselves,
and for the ladies the staff of maids had to “go round.”</p>

<p>Pendleton began bluntly: “It’s about this foolishness of
Parson Lolly.”</p>

<p>Blenkinson lifted the lid of one eye, the better to observe
the master of the House. “And did you mean to say, sir, if I
may make so bold, that any of <em>us</em> have anything to do with
the honfortunate affair?”</p>

<p>“Everything, everything!” said Crofts, and to allay a hum
of dismay and dignity offended, hastily added, “Oh, don’t
misunderstand, please. I mean just this: this Parson Lolly—this
ridiculous Parson Lolly—of course, we don’t believe in any
such nonsense. What I want to do is to get from each one of
you, if you can pull yourselves together and give plain,
straightforward statements—I want to find the origin of this
folk-tale—this fairy-story—from each one of you—that is—do you
see?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say as we do—speakin’ for me at least,” drawled a
gaunt tawny-faced man in a leather coat and vest and corduroy
riding-breeches, a cartridge-belt hanging over his arm. His voice
had the pleasant modulation of this countryside, with a little
chirruppy uptilt at the end of each phrase.</p>

<p>“Hughes, I expected—you see, of course, that it’s that
common talk of you—all of you—and such as you, that spreads
such wild, romantic, and unfounded legends through the
countryside. Now, a man four hundred years old—which of you
has seen such a man?”</p>

<p>“If I may hinterpose,” came in Blenkinson again, “I might
remind you, sir, that most of us are not of Welsh extraction.
These foolish stories don’t ’ave much credit with us from
London and other parts, you may be sure.”</p>

<p>This speech was approved by vigorous nods on the part
of several, while three or four, the darker-faced and smaller
ones, glowered for a bit, particularly two of the women,
strikingly handsome and strikingly alike. Old Finlay the gardener
smiled with sublime sarcasm, such as to elicit a question from
Pendleton.</p>

<p>“I was thinkin’ as how they was all flummoxed and flabbergasted
last night. It tickle me—that it do. They fules!” The
ancient slapped his knee and burst into a silent guffaw. “Why,
they tales—”</p>

<p>“One moment, Finlay,” said Pendleton; “we must go
through this in an orderly way.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” Blenkinson cautioned.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes, of course—what you say is very true—forgotten
about it.” Pendleton scratched his head, saw light
suddenly. “Why, of course, er—most of you are English, not
British—”</p>

<p>“What’s that, sir?”</p>

<p>“Not Welsh—same thing. I suppose, then—there won’t be
much—well, let’s see how much we do know. I’ll take you in
turn.”</p>

<p>He spoke to the men standing by the screen. “Wheeler,
Tenney, Morgan—any of you had any, er, experiences in the
stables? Wheeler?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered a young, rubicund fellow with a swollen
and discoloured cheek and blue-ringed eye. (He drove the
Pendleton car.) “Nothing but when we were called out last
night.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get that eye?”</p>

<p>“Fell over pitchfork, sir, and hit the side of a stall.”</p>

<p>“Tenney, you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.” He who answered was a tired-looking man, whose
eyelids were most of the time let down. The two words, his
total contribution to the inquiry, were drawn out to the length
of polysyllables.</p>

<p>“Morgan, you’re a Welshman from around this district. You
must have a lot of these old wives’ tales simmering inside that
head of yours.”</p>

<p>The man, a swart, square-bearded little man, speaking with
the sing-song of local accent, answered that he had heard tell
of Parson Lolly “out of the cradle.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no doubt—ignorant folly,” commented Pendleton.
“Well, what is all this nonsense?”</p>

<p>“You mean about Parson Lolly, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what about him?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, they do say he be the biggest of the farises and
he be out of sight of any man for age.”</p>

<p>“Farises?”</p>

<p>“He means the fairies, sir,” interpreted one of the women,
a mite of a person sitting on the edge of her chair, with a wisp
of tartan colour at the throat of her black lady’s maid’s
uniform.</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, Ardelia, thanks,” exclaimed Pendleton, while the
stableman Morgan mumbled something about the propriety of
a “not Welshly person’s” keeping still, and one of the two
handsome women gave her small fellow-servant an unsisterly
look and ejaculated, “Hop-o’-my-thumb!”</p>

<p>“Go on, Morgan,” bade Pendleton, quieting a general stir.</p>

<p>The ensuing account was full of omens and transformation,
of black calves and fairy ovens, of wizard marks, sucking pigs,
“low winds,” and horses ridden by the “goblin trot” in stables
at night.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, man! Do you believe all this?”</p>

<p>The “London servants” and those from other parts tittered.</p>

<p>Morgan seemed to be weighing his words. “Well, that be
hard to say, sir.”</p>

<p>“What’s hard about it? Don’t you know what believing is?”</p>

<p>“Right well I do, sir, but—”</p>

<p>The small Ardelia woman with the fleck of colour at her
collar bobbed forward. “If he can’t say it, I’ll say it for him.
Sometimes he does believe, and sometimes he doesn’t. Now,
Saul Morgan, say if ’tisn’t so.”</p>

<p>The stableman gave her a critical glare, but assented. “That’s
nigh the way of it, as Miss Lacy says, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well!” snorted the interlocutor. “Sometimes you do and
sometimes you don’t! And what causes these changes of front?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir?”</p>

<p>“What makes you believe—”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, sometimes it’s right dark outside, you
understand, and things or somethin’ you can’t see—well, they—”</p>

<p>“What, the things you can’t see?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. They have a way of surely creepin’ in your blood,
if you understand what I mean, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Pendleton, settling back, and, I thought,
shivering a little, “I suppose I do.”</p>

<p>Morgan, on account of his complete and ingenuous exegesis
of the lore of Parson Lolly, the object of much ironic
commiseration from the “Londoners,” pulled out a florid
handkerchief and wiped the beads from his brow. He stole a
half-ashamed glance at the diminutive Ardelia Lacy, whose wide
disapproving eyes made him squirm and shrink.</p>

<p>Pendleton turned to the women ranged along the wall, whose
examination was shorter. Harmony, Em, and Jael, minxes with
buxom bodies and good fresh faces, were “not Welshly people,”
and had no traditions of Parson Lolly in their mental make-up,
but they evidently had some respect for him born of the stories
of indigenous servants. Harmony’s troubled look showed, to be
sure, that she was remembering painfully to keep the secret of
the new announcement of the Parson, but by none save Crofts
and me was her embarrassment marked. Ardelia Lacy, minute
and prim, personal maid of Alberta Pendleton, was also a
“Londoner.”</p>

<p>The two dark-featured, vivacious women, were the “Clays,”
Rosa and Ruth, cook and housekeeper, nieces, it appeared, of
Hughes. Rosa Clay it was who had shown a little animosity
toward the “foreign” Ardelia, indicating possibly a rivalry in
respect to the favour of Morgan the stableman. They knew of
no doings of Parson Lolly prior to the arrival of the guests for
the Bidding Feast.</p>

<p>There remained three men-servants grouped in chairs about
the foot of the table: Blenkinson the staid, Soames, footman,
with mutton-chops and unction, and old Finlay the gardener
with his irrepressible silent guffaws. And in the background
against the screen loomed the figure of the man in out-of-doors
clothing and cartridge-belt, the gamekeeper. Crofts looked
at Soames and Blenkinson reflectively, but passed them as
already examined. He raised his eyes.</p>

<p>“How about you, Hughes?”</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> about me, sir?” Again the keeper’s voice betrayed
his kinship of race with Morgan.</p>

<p>“You, too, have this mythology of the Parson pat, like
Morgan?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I hardly think Morgan had it ‘pat,’ as you say,”
answered the man, turning the eyes in his motionless head
toward the stableman, who muttered something unintelligible.
“I don’t think he was very well taught, sir—things mixed up,
or something, and things that didn’t belong there, you might
say. Now, as it was always told me—I come from down
Powys-way, sir—”</p>

<p>“You surprise me, Hughes, a man of your age and sense.
Now, what about this? While the House was empty and you
and the rest were caretaking, what signs were of Parson Lolly
then? I don’t mean larks and pigeons—I mean real evidence
lying around, or real activity.”</p>

<p>“Nothing, sir.”</p>

<p>“Not anywhere in the preserve? Not in the whole estate?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Nothing used to happen until you brought down
the folk that are here now.”</p>

<p>“I see, I see. And you know nothing of the cause of the
disturbances of the last few days?”</p>

<p>There was an ominous pause, while Hughes seemed to be
considering his words. The room grew a little tenser;
Pendleton looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>“What! You do!”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I might say so; it’s connected with what I’ve
heard about Parson Lolly. But it’s an old story, sir—tells
about the great lord who built the castle that was here.”</p>

<p>“Ha! it does? About Sir Pharamond Kay?”</p>

<p>“It’s sure to, sir.”</p>

<p>“Sir Pharamond—hm—built this castle—exactly—well,
come on, man; what is this?”</p>

<p>Contrasted with Morgan’s, that was a thoroughly intelligible
tale the tall keeper recited in his voice with the mellow burr
and up-ended sentences. Under those conditions of semi-darkness
and suspense in the old, black-beamed chamber, it made a
thoroughly moving story. And to one who knew the rigours and
alarums of feudatory existence, who realized the ingrown awe
of their masters felt by peasants with a long tradition of
ancestral servitude to imperious Lords Marchers, it was quite
obvious what a foothold in fact this tale of enchantments must
have had. For from his youth, or ever that most ancient castle
up the Vale was destroyed, Sir Pharamond Kay had been a
wizard, and between him and Parson Lolly, then presumably
a magnus in the prime of his powers, existed a rivalry shrewd
and unflagging!</p>

<p>Wizards, to be sure, are not born but made, and Sir Pharamond
went through complicated and profound measures to acquire
his occult influence. This was before he had achieved his
turbulent lordship, and his father ruled all Aidenn Forest with
mailed fist. Sir Pharamond first unbaptized himself by three
times spewing out water from the Holy Well. Then he stitched
up his own lips with three stitches and for a certain space
fasted and remained dumb. When he had unsealed his mouth
again, he went by himself to a lonely room and did certain
rites with a Bible, a fire, and a circle drawn with blood upon
the floor, whereafter the Bible was ashes and Sir Pharamond,
as he well deserved, was a true and certified wizard.</p>

<p>All this while Parson Lolly, whose sphere of influence
included Aidenn Forest, had been watching the career of the
ambitious necromancer with baleful interest, and now the older
magician believed that he must try conclusions with the usurper
or be shorn of his potency in this region. In the guise of a
skipping hare he invaded the castle, and having come into the
presence of its lord, suddenly assumed his wizard shape and
challenged Sir Pharamond to a contest for supremacy. This
took place at the Four Stones (monuments of an eldern time
still standing lonely in a field-corner some miles beyond the
mouth of the Vale) and the Lord of Aidenn proved to have
an Evil Eye so strong the Parson was put to rout. In the
form of a buzzard he fled to the desolate summit of Black
Mixen at the top of Aidenn Forest. But Sir Pharamond, having
assumed the shape of a small caterpillar, clung with all his
legs between the shoulders of the bird and reconfronted his
rival when he alighted where The Riggles are now. Those
enormous scratches are the marks of his buzzard-claws.</p>

<p>Then when the Parson strove with powers enforced by the
deadly fear he was in, the tide of battle turned. On that solitary
hilltop, moreover, the elemental influences were on the side of
the older magician. With a dart of his beak the Parson sank a
deep wound in the cheek of Sir Pharamond, destroying the
efficacy of his Evil Eye. Then it was the Lord of Aidenn’s time
to flee, and he escaped to the innermost black sanctuary of his
castle.</p>

<p>But Parson Lolly overthrew the castle, whose skeleton of
clay slate chunks lies wasting up the Vale to this day.</p>

<p>Thenceforth, although Sir Pharamond lived on, his magic
was only the shadow of what it had been, and he lived in
perpetual dread of Parson Lolly. He built him a new castle where
the mill had stood, and where Highglen House stands to-day.
But he never found content within his re-erected halls. The
menace of the Parson hung over his days and nights. Whenever
in his woeful heart he meditated regaining his former
ascendancy, from the cheek of his portrait on the wall blood
would run and in his own cheek he would feel overwhelming
pain, as when the Parson had driven his buzzard-beak into the
flesh.</p>

<p>“One moment!” interjected Crofts. “Do you mean the
painting in the corridor?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; it’s that little one way up on the wall of the
Hall of the Moth as I mean.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” My host licked somewhat dry lips. “Go on.”</p>

<p>“There’s not so much more to it, sir, I expect. The Parson
finally <em>would</em> make an end of Sir Pharamond. He sent Sir
Pharamond’s own corpse-candle for Sir Pharamond to see.”</p>

<p>“Corpse-candle!”</p>

<p>“A dimmery light, sir—it floats in the air. It’s a sure sign
of a death in these parts. And the Tolaeth sounded, too; so
Sir Pharamond knew then that it was all up with him.”</p>

<p>“The Tolaeth—I don’t think I know what that means,”
said Crofts. The Welsh folk stirred just a little.</p>

<p>The keeper’s voice fell, I do not think by design. “The
rappin’s, sir, that come just before a person dies. Tappin’, sir,
like—”</p>

<p>Our hearts were in our throats while he finished the speech
in a sudden gasp—“like that.”</p>

<p>For from the other side of the corridor wall, high toward
the ceiling, had sounded three sharp knocks.</p>

<p>And again, before a breath was taken in the room, three
knocks again—and again.</p>

<p>“It’s the Three Thumps.” Morgan’s voice was that of a
strangling man.</p>

<p>“Coffin-making,” muttered one of the Clay sisters, her eyes
lightless.</p>

<p>I saw Crofts’ glance flit about the room, taking in the whole
group. I, too, had thought of collusion, but the number of
servants was complete; none had slipped out while the keeper’s
story was in progress.</p>

<p>Crofts remained irresolute for only a few seconds before he
jumped up and sprang to the door, flung it open and glared
down the corridor.</p>

<p>“Empty,” he said, and I could not tell whether satisfaction
or distress was uppermost in his voice. Then the silence for a
bit was blank and appalling. He returned to the table. “Get
on with your story, Hughes. We’ll find out about this fol-de-rol
later.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, the Lord of Aidenn was sure to fight the Parson
again when the signs had come. He still tried to get back his
magic power, and the blood stood out on the picture and the
pain came in his cheek. But he knew that it was life-and-death,
and he kept repeating his spells and made a man of wax against
the Parson. But just as he was going to drive a bodkin through
the man of wax, the pain of his old wound made him stagger,
and everyone heard the Parson laughing though they couldn’t
see him, and the portrait fell down from the wall—and Sir
Pharamond was dead!”</p>

<p>All of us, I believe, drew a long, grateful breath. Crofts sat
quietly, seeming to cogitate.</p>

<p>At length he said, “Look here, Hughes. That’s a priceless
fairy-tale, but what makes you think it may have any
connection with what’s going on here?”</p>

<p>The keeper hunched a shoulder toward the corridor wall.
“You’ve just heard that, sir. And if there <em>is</em> a Parson Lolly,
sir—”</p>

<p>Crofts leapt in the breach to nullify this dangerous beginning.
“We’ll not discuss such a preposterous supposition.”</p>

<p>“They do say, sir,” appended Hughes, “that blood will come
on the face of the picture when the time comes for Highglen
House to be destroyed.”</p>

<p>“Destroyed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. By Parson Lolly.”</p>

<p>There was no denying that Hughes had scored several palpable
hits, besides the unaccountable business of the knocking
on the wall, and Crofts was glad to dismiss him, so to speak,
from the witness-box.</p>

<p>I, seated in the embrasure of the window a little way behind
Pendleton, had an unobstructed view of the upper iron-bound
door leading into the portrait-corridor. While, then, I
happened to glance at the substantial iron handle of the door,
for it had no knob, the roots of my hair stirred and a thrill
shot down my spine.</p>

<p>For, very slowly, the black bar was turning while something
outside softly pressed downward on the handle.</p>

<p>The fascination that took hold of me then was almost
hypnotic. I forgot the room, the people there, the cracked
fleering voice of the old gardener; all that existed for me then
was the slowly descending bar. To call attention to the thing
never so much as occurred to me. Nothing occurred to me.
When the bolt of the lock had been drawn back, the door
began to open with imperceptible motion—an inch—two
inches—and was at rest. The handle gradually returned to its
horizontal position. It seemed as if I had taken only one breath
during those four or five minutes.</p>

<p>Crofts’ questioning went on, and little by little I came out
from the spell of the door, which remained ajar. The questioning
went on, with some secret listener outside in the passage.
Still I held silence, for, clouded with excitement as was my
mind in those minutes, the notion of danger did not possess me.
I kept my eyes on the motionless door, dreading that it might
open further, distinctly unwilling to see what it might
disclose—and the questioning went on.</p>

<p>Pendleton was learning nothing from Finlay; I was vaguely
aware that the old gardener was fencing with the over-anxious
Crofts.</p>

<p>Then a thing occurred to relieve the tension: from the
kitchen entry came sound of hurried movement, of a dish falling
to the floor, and presently was visible the tousled head of a
boy peering around the edge of the screen, a head surprised into
a gape by sight of the assemblage.</p>

<p>“Come in, Toby,” said Crofts. “We’re—”</p>

<p>“I just got back, sir, with Mr. Bannerlee’s bag and all.
Oh, sir,” cried the head, bringing its body into the room, “the
Water’s swellin’ awfully from the rain—”</p>

<p>His hair was quite tangential, and his shoes and clothing
bore marks of the storm. An ulster dangled both ends from his
shoulders. He was breathing hard with exertion added to stress
of spirit.</p>

<p>Pendleton began to explain to him: “We are trying to clear
up this business of—”</p>

<p>“I waited under ellum, till the rain stopped,” persisted the
excited lad. “It went under old bridge with a roar and a roar.
I misdoubt—”</p>

<p>The exciting thought of the door softly released and pushed
ajar had grown weaker in my mind upon the entrance of Toby.
But again my eyes chanced to light upon the portal, and
again my blood rushed pell-mell through a throbbing temple.
For, unless my senses were false, the door trembled a little, as
if uncertain whether to open farther or to shut. The secret
watcher’s hand must be upon it still!</p>

<p>In a daze I arose and came out of my retirement in the
window-place.</p>

<p>“Crofts,” I said. . . . “Crofts.”</p>

<p>So hushed was my voice that he spun around in his chair
with open mouth, and the servants’ chorus gave a slight gasp.</p>

<p>I tried to open a path through my throat for words to issue.</p>

<p>“Crofts . . . there’s something—someone, I
mean—watching us.”</p>

<p>“How? What on earth do you mean? What’s the matter
with you?”</p>

<p>I extended my arm toward where showed a long narrow
slit of blackness between jamb and door-edge.</p>

<p>“There.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>My courage was small, but I summoned more to add to
what I had. “I saw the door opened from the passageway.
I tell you this inquiry has been overheard.”</p>

<p>I strode toward the door, while from behind me came the
scrape of Crofts rising to his feet, and the rustle of the
servants. Open that door I would, if the fourfold centenarian
himself were waiting outside to do me mischief. But I believed,
and would not have been sorry to discover, that the unknown
visitant had by this time fled, and with this hope upholding me
I gripped the handle-piece and jerked the portal open.</p>

<p>But no! A man stood in the corridor.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch08">

<h2>VIII. <br> Wager of Battel</h2>

<p>Gilbert Maryvale!</p>

<p>“Oh, you!” exclaimed Pendleton, and appeared completely
contented at once.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it awful?” asked Maryvale. “Isn’t it awful?”</p>

<p>Pendleton and I stared speechless at him; in me, at least,
the old surprise had given place to new astonishment twice as
strong. What was the matter with this man? The only light
in the long windowless corridor came from a translucent electric
globe far at the foot of the stairs, but even in the vaguely
illuminated passage I realized that something had happened
to Maryvale.</p>

<p>“I saw the boy coming by the drive, and I thought he
might—there might be some news of Sir Brooke at last. The doctor
is telling some powerful things. I’ve been in and out of there
twice. I always—I thought I’d better get away . . . came to
see if the boy had . . .”</p>

<p>“One question, Mr. Maryvale,” I said quickly. “Were you
in the corridor a while ago tapping the wall with something?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, with my friend Crofts’ cane.” He turned to our
host. “But I assure you I did not harm the cane.”</p>

<p>“The cane be hanged,” responded Crofts. “But why in
thunder did you do it?”</p>

<p>An expression vanished from Maryvale’s eyes almost before
it deepened there, a softness, a look of meekness, a chastened
look; I thought it a revelation of painful things kept
subdued.</p>

<p>“Something suggested to me that there might be a secret
passage in one of the walls of the corridor. I was trying, high
up—”</p>

<p>Our host made a disgusted sound. “One thing you may depend
upon, Gilbert, no matter what happens. In this extant
portion of the castle there are no secret passages. There’s not
so much as a priest’s hole or a trap-door or a double wall to a
cupboard. There’s one bogie laid, anyhow. You may as well
know that you made fools of us in there. Where the devil did
you go afterward?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if I annoyed you. I just went back into the
Hall of the Moth. But Doctor Aire—I didn’t care for the
hobby of Doctor Aire. So I returned again to hear if there
was anything about Sir Brooke.”</p>

<p>The servants, of course, had clustered around the door with
quite natural and honourable inquisitiveness. Pendleton turned
on them.</p>

<p>“You may go—and mind, don’t talk about this all
afternoon. The subject is closed.” Ah, trustful Crofts!</p>

<p>So out of the dining-hall they filed to their aloof world of
below-stairs: Ruth and Rosa Clay of lustrous person, Ardelia
Lacy (giving the Welsh stableman a look in passing that was
obviously a piece of her mind, though its crushing significance
was hardly clear from the evidence), the maids, Jael, Em, and
Harmony. Morgan and his fellow stablemen, Tenney and
Wheeler, got out next, and the tall keeper gravely followed
them behind the screen. Soames and Blenkinson both had hard
work getting rid of old Finlay, who seemed to think that the
occasion demanded more of his japes, and who finally thrust
his head out from behind the screen for one last comprehensive
wink at me.</p>

<p>Pendleton turned to the boy, who had set about his
somewhat unorthodox task of clearing the dessert dishes.</p>

<p>“Did you inquire about Sir Brooke, Toby?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I did,” answered the lad, looking white over a
load of china and glass ware on a tray.</p>

<p>“No news, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir, as a fact there was, sir.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Who told you?”</p>

<p>“It was the station-master at New Aidenn, sir. He was
very angry, sir, when I told him that you didn’t believe he
had seen Sir Brooke. He said to tell you, sir, that he was
certain-sure. Those were the words I was to tell you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did he take a ticket from him?”</p>

<p>“He can’t exactly remember, sir, but he’s sure he saw him
somewhere in the crowd. He must have taken his ticket,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” exclaimed Pendleton. “Why, I have a letter from
Sir—”</p>

<p>Toby continued in his unruffled style. “And he said he
remembered Sir Brooke very well from other times he was here,
sir. A thinnish, middle-sized gentleman, with a bang of
mouse-coloured hair over his eye, and double glasses, and his silk
bow tie tilted toward his ear. He remembered him quite well,
you see, sir.”</p>

<p>“It seems,” said I, putting in my oar for the first time,
“that <em>you</em> remember remarkably well, Toby.”</p>

<p>The boy gazed at me as if I were a sport of nature, a
phenomenon of dubiety amazing. “Why, he made me repeat
what he said until I had it by heart, sir. He was very angry,
Mr. Pendleton.”</p>

<p>Pendleton was in a brown study, until I plucked his sleeve
and whispered. “Thinking won’t help. Let’s get out of here,
or the boy will have something to regale the servants with.”</p>

<p>But Toby now proffered a request. “Please, sir, will it
be all right if I take a picture of the servants to-night? Miss
Lebetwood gave me her old flash-light camera when she came
down this time, sir, and I want to use it.”</p>

<p>(Photography—not topography!)</p>

<p>“Why, hm, yes, I suppose so. Are the servants for it?”</p>

<p>“Some are afraid of the flash, sir, but I’ll show ’em how
it works.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, then, after dinner. Don’t blow up the place.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. I won’t, sir. Miss Lebetwood will help
me, sir.”</p>

<p>Maryvale was still standing in the corridor when we came
out.</p>

<p>Crofts relieved his pent-up bitterness. “What a man! He
sends me a letter, very explanatory, containing three words:
‘Wait for me.’ He arrives at New Aidenn station last
evening, but doesn’t deign to make use of the car I sent to
meet the train; he even avoids speaking to the chauffeur,
to mention that he intends to walk. He then strolls off
somewhere, apparently to lie low until it pleases him to disclose
himself. He’ll be lucky if he finds the house occupied when
he makes his appearance.”</p>

<p>“But he may have got lost, of course.”</p>

<p>“I had men out searching. Every foot of the Vale was
beaten last night.”</p>

<p>“Still, your men may have missed him.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” Crofts declared with fine sarcasm, “suppose
the gentleman did get lost and have to sleep in the nasty,
damp Vale and get sniffles. Where’s he been all to-day?
Climbing about up there where you were yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Ah, now you are asking reasonably. I can’t imagine. What
is it, Mr. Maryvale?”</p>

<p>For Maryvale had suddenly grasped my arm. Now he
released it, and ignored my question.</p>

<p>I could not gauge the look on the face of the “man of business”;
it appeared to have volcanic possibilities, yet subterranean
still. To regain the trivial and commonplace, I sounded
Crofts on the matter that had irritated me ever since I had
seen the unstartling words in the letter of dispute last night.</p>

<p>“By the way, Crofts, I may have to be sending out a
message or two if I remain here long—”</p>

<p>“Of course you’ll remain—”</p>

<p>“Where’s the mail for posting?”</p>

<p>“Why, just hand whatever you have to one of the servants.
If you need stationery—”</p>

<p>“But isn’t there a particular place—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, if it’s more convenient—there’s a rack for outgoing
mail under the staircase. It hangs above the end of the
settle.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Maryvale was busy fingering the lower part of the wide
gilt frame of one of the portraits, a full length representation
of a man in cuirass and metal thigh-plates, holding his helmet
in one hand, leaning with the other arm upon a convenient
pedestal; his narrow face looked like that of a newly-elected
thane of Hell.</p>

<p>“<em>That’s</em> Sir Pharamond Kay,” Pendleton remarked, “first
builder of the castle this House is remnant of.”</p>

<p>“Yes . . . yes,” Maryvale murmured to himself, concluding
his investigation of the frame. “The gilding is valuable at
any rate.”</p>

<p>Pendleton and I reciprocated glances of bewilderment, but
Maryvale seemed disinclined to explain himself further. He
was even unwilling to precede us back into the Hall of the
Moth, which he had deserted a little while before, and wherein
the entire rest of the company were still listening to Doctor
Aire. Alberta Pendleton received us with her charming smile,
and we took places beside her at the foot of the room, and that
other, smaller, bewitched or accursed portrait of Sir
Pharamond glared down on me from the wall.</p>

<p>The rain having ceased long before, and the clouds being
a little broken, the sun was, so to speak, red in the face from
trying to dry the lawn. The french windows were opened,
through the northern one we caught glimpses of the glassman
from New Aidenn making whole the damaged conservatory
window. But there was no tendency toward seeking the
out-of-doors. Most of the party were quite sated with the open-air
sports afforded in Aidenn Vale.</p>

<p>Doctor Aire, moreover, would have demanded attention under
any circumstances. Apart from the fascination of his subject,
there was authority in the clipped, methodical manner of
his speech. Just now he was telling of the last case of Appeal
of Murder, that relic of early ages whereby one acquitted of a
death-crime could be compelled to defend himself anew by
the might of his body. As late as 1819, it appeared, one
Thornton, when acquitted, and when the dead girl’s brother had
made Appeal of Murder against him, had thrown down
in challenge to “wager of battel”—this we were in time to
hear—a gauntlet as strange as the occasion, without either
fingers or thumbs, made of white tanned skin, ornamented
with sewn tracery and silk fringes, crossed by a narrow
band of red leather with leather tags and thongs for
fastening.</p>

<p>Cosgrove was listening. But of a sudden it seemed to me that
his attention was curiously directed beyond Doctor Aire,
beyond the vicissitudes of the accused and acquitted Thornton,
who had needed to go on trial again with only the prowess of
his body to defend himself.</p>

<p>“Listening, surely,” I told myself, and asked myself, “<em>For
what?</em>” . . .</p>

<p>Doctor Aire’s recital went on, encyclopedically.</p>

<p>“Lord Ellenborough had to admit that the procedure was
competent, although there had not been a whisper of the
Appeal throughout the kingdom for forty years. But the curious
crowd was disappointed when the appellant withdrew; so there
was no gladiatorial exhibition for the chief justice to preside
over. It is extremely unlikely that Mary Ashford’s brother
had ever intended to carry his Appeal into force, he being a
slighter man of body than the appellee—and for that reason
Thornton had probably been emboldened to make the brave
show he did with his extraordinary gauntlet of white tanned
leather.”</p>

<p>In the half-darkness underneath the musicians’ gallery were
a pair of listeners who had been within neither the range of
my vision nor the scope of my thought. Now one of them, the
young American, Bob Cullen, became in an instant the cynosure
of the company.</p>

<p>For the youth, scarcely more than a lad, rose from his seat
beside Lib Dale, and the exclamation that came from his lips
twisted every neck in the Hall.</p>

<p>“So <em>that</em> was it!” The expression of ire on those young,
unformed features was almost comical.</p>

<p>Despite a hurried, “Bob, don’t be sil,” from Lib, the youth
advanced a couple of steps toward Cosgrove, leaving no doubt
against whom his wrath was directed. He raised his shaking
arm and pointed at the Irishman, he opened his mouth and was
attempting articulate words, but only one word issued, a
smothered one:</p>

<p>“You—you—”</p>

<p>Cosgrove’s face was a thing to watch, while the parade of
emotions passed across it. Mere surprise vanished with the first
turn of his head along with the rest of the heads. His eyes
widened, but for a few seconds were blank with absolute
stupefaction, and when enlightenment finally appeared to come within
him, the resentment expressed in his lowering brows and glowing
eyes seemed to be mingled with a sense of shame, or else
there was no meaning in the sidewise shift of those eyes and in
those irresolute lips. He swallowed, and his head made a small,
sharp jerk in the act. A muscle twitched in his cheek. Bob
Cullen was still saying, “You—you—” and Lib Dale was
whispering dire things to him.</p>

<p>That other, admirable, American tried to deal with the
frenzied youth. Paula Lebetwood said, “Bob, you’re making a
child of yourself. Remember where you are.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” asked Ludlow in a matter-of-fact
tone.</p>

<p>“Ask him—ask him, that’s all!” cried Bob Cullen bitterly,
and then, as is the wont of youths who believe themselves
wronged, commenced himself to explain. “He thought—you
thought, Mr. Cosgrove”—(“<em>Mr.</em>” Cosgrove; much revealed
by that “Mr.”)—“you thought that because you were bigger
and stronger than I was, that you could get away with talking
the way you did. Well, you needn’t think that it was
because I was afraid of you—”</p>

<p>I noticed that Lib Dale was actually twisting her young
compatriot’s arm in an endeavour to gain his attention, but he
held on through pain, white and red by turns.</p>

<p>“I’m ready any time you are, Mr. Cosgrove, and don’t you
forget it. I’ll show you, Mr. Cosgrove. I’ll fight you a duel or
a wager of battle or anything—”</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” slipped in Doctor Aire, who took the
interruption of his narrative in very good humour, “the wager of
battle is null and void. That was the whole upshot of my
story, if you had only the patience—”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if it’s null and void or not. Mr. Cosgrove, if
you’re a man—”</p>

<p>Paula Lebetwood had taken hold of the half-hysterical
youth’s other arm; she placed a firm hand across his mouth,
effectually stifling what further wild challenge he might have
uttered on the spot. Lib sank down flushed and pouting, her
blue eyes flinging defiance to all of us. Cosgrove, who had not
uttered a word, had a face like a man’s in an apoplexy, and
his head was lower between his shoulders than it was accustomed
to be.</p>

<p>The youngster Bob Cullen was still standing there like a
bulldog in the centre of the ring, anger adding a degree of
dignity to his stature. Ten, twenty, seconds may have gone by,
and still he confronted the Irishman, whose only recognition
of his challenge had been a turn of his head and that slow dark
flame in his face.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Bob Cullen.</p>

<p>Still the Irishman preserved a silence of stone.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob, you sorehead,” cried Lib Dale, grinding her
heel into the carpet. “Of all the id—”</p>

<p>“But Bob, dear,” pleaded Miss Lebetwood, “what Sean said
to Lib was long, long ago in the spring, and she’s forgotten
all about it, and so should you, you silly kid.”</p>

<p>The voice of Cosgrove came thundering, overwhelming.
“Woman,” he said, and a quite perceptible thrill passed over
us, for he spoke to his intended wife, and “woman” as he said
it then sounded the most brutal word he could use—“woman,
no need for you to defend me. The code of this young upstart
is not my code, by the heavens—nor is yours my code. Stand
aside.”</p>

<p>“Sean!”</p>

<p>“Stand aside—did you hear?”</p>

<p>“But Sean—”</p>

<p>“While the light is in me, I shall offer it to you, woman,
and to all others I find in need of grace—even if it gall your
young upstart there.”</p>

<p>Paula Lebetwood had tottered a step backward, with an
expression of the utmost pain and loss upon her face. Suddenly
her face was hidden in her hands, and her shoulders heaved
with swift gusts of feeling. Then she lifted her face tearless
and hot-eyed and defiant beneath golden hair turning to riot.</p>

<p>“Sean, how unmanly, how cowardly! Oh, if you knew
how I despise you now. Oh, I need air—air!”</p>

<p>She turned from us abruptly, then paused. Her bosom
moved in a long, slow breathing, and she turned her head to
look at her lover, whose gaze did not meet hers. A veil of
anger seemed to fall from her features, and the fire softened in
her eyes. But this was no melting mood. Instead, a serene
aloofness reigned in her face, and she seemed like one who studied
Cosgrove from some region above, studied him with sympathy
and compassion. For a space of time—perhaps a minute—there
was this silence. Then, as if she had shown enough that
she was not embittered by passion, she departed swiftly.</p>

<p>Through the passage of the french windows she strode, out
to the lawn, and across, to be lost to sight in shrubs alongside
the gate-house.</p>

<p>So, splitting into new faction and fresh enmity at every
hour, the Bidding Feast at last witnessed the discord of the
lovers themselves.</p>

<p>Cosgrove’s rebuke of his betrothed had stunned us, and her
answering rebuke had left us wild and speechless. None stirred
to follow Miss Lebetwood. In me, at least, the strife of feeling
was comparable to the mad stress of the night before, when
the first message of Parson Lolly had been found. I knew a
delirium of bewilderment, a very horror, in the instants
following those outbursts.</p>

<p>Cosgrove’s face, now so blotted with blood, took fantastic
dimensions, seemed twice its size. The room appeared an
enormous room, and the people pigmy people. Sir Pharamond’s
portrait leered and sneered. Every proportion was indecently
distorted, and time, like space, was bereft of its comfortable
conventions. The seconds seemed to stagger past.</p>

<p>Then Pendleton, no longer held by Alberta, rose so hastily
that his chair banged backward against the stair-post of the
little gallery. “Yes, by gad! Let’s all get some air. This room is
stuffy as blazes. That’s what puts us all at sixes and sevens.”</p>

<p>“I really think,” observed Eve Bartholomew, “that it’s the
absence of Sir Brooke that gets so on our nerves.”</p>

<p>“Let’s declare a truce—no, let’s make peace,” smiled Alberta
Pendleton. “Sean, you and Bob haven’t any ill-will, have you?”</p>

<p>Since his betrothed’s condemnation of him, no petty enmity
could very well find hold in Cosgrove’s soul. His defeat told
in his dejected head and drooped lids. He didn’t answer
Alberta.</p>

<p>But Bob Cullen, whose excitement had flagged, was
suddenly overwhelmed by his former audacity. “I—I suppose
you folks must think—you must think—”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Bob,” soothed Alberta; “you just lost
your temper for a minute, that was all. Anybody is likely to
do that.”</p>

<p>“He let Mr. Cosgrove get his goat,” put in Lib Dale in a
<i>sotto voce obbligato</i>; she was still much displeased with her
compatriot.</p>

<p>“I’m—I’m sorry—I apologize,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“As for me,” said Cosgrove suddenly, “I do more than
apologize; I make anew.”</p>

<p>“Why, Sean, how—what can you mean?” gasped Alberta,
for the Irishman now stood on his feet looking around the
Hall without explaining his remark.</p>

<p>“Yes, it will do,” muttered Cosgrove. “God can come from
there”; and he gestured toward the musicians’ gallery.</p>

<p>“G-g-god?” stammered Pendleton.</p>

<p>“God the Creator,” responded Sean Cosgrove, and he appended
a few words as inconsequential as any Crofts himself
could have used: “I’ve seen the book in your library.”</p>

<p>“But what do you mean, man?” cried Pendleton. “I never
heard—”</p>

<p>“To-night,” said Cosgrove, “in this Hall we shall rehearse
the play of ‘Noah’s Flood.’ ”</p>

<p>“ ‘Noah’s Flood!’ ” came a gasp from most of us.</p>

<p>“Animal crackers,” mumbled Bob Cullen obscurely.</p>

<p>“What’s ‘Noah’s Flood?’ ” asked Pendleton. “I’ve never
seen any book of that name—”</p>

<p>“It is inside a book of another name,” answered Cosgrove;
“one you have never opened, I dare say. Here, at five o’clock,
we shall have tea; is it not so? Then I shall unfold—”</p>

<p>“It’s an old mystery-play,” said Alberta. “Crofts, I’m
surprised.”</p>

<p>“But won’t there be, er, costumes, and so forth?”</p>

<p>“For me, at least, no costume,” declared Cosgrove. “Man,
made in the image of God, shall need no gaudery. I should
scorn to deck and disguise myself to play my God.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that you’re to appear in the, er, in the—”</p>

<p>“In the altogether?” finished Eve Bartholomew in a thin
quasi-hysterical tone. “Oh, Mr. Cosgrove—”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” Doctor Aire put in sardonically, “Sean is
thinking of the mediaeval way of playing Adam and Eve with a
screen up to their necks.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” said Cosgrove.</p>

<p>“But won’t all this furniture have to be shifted?” inquired
Pendleton nervously.</p>

<p>“Leave it to me.”</p>

<p>“Alone—how will you do it?”</p>

<p>“With my God-given arms.”</p>

<p>“But shouldn’t the servants—”</p>

<p>“I will do everything that must be done. But first,” and
here I thought Cosgrove became a little wistful, “let us go
outside and breathe the God-given air. Leave all to me;
assemble here at five o’clock.”</p>

<p>He marched out, his face, with a look of grim regret and
determination, turned toward the place in the shrubbery where
Paula Lebetwood had disappeared. The last we saw of him, he
had followed her out of sight.</p>

<p>The company began to disband.</p>

<h2>IX. <br> The Bone</h2>

<p>He might hardly have been in the Hall of the Moth
all afternoon, had my impressions been evidence—so quiet he
had kept, relapsed out of the main light of the room into the
shadow between the beetling chimney-mantel and the old long-case
clock. Perhaps the indefatigable quaffing of whiskey-and-sodas,
which industry is surely his favourite, had proved
soporific in that dusky alcove, whence only his crossed feet
had appeared, shod sparklingly, spatted sprucely. But now
Charlton Oxford, glazed to a hair, waxed to a needle, was
standing in the aperture of the opened french windows, and
his look, whatever his legs might be, was steady.</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed upon the gap in the lawn shrubs where
Sean Cosgrove had disappeared. Surely that was an unguarded
moment; his speech, although low, was vehement, since it was
addressed to a man now far out of sight and hearing:</p>

<p>“Your code, hey? Your damned code.” He wiped the back
of his fist savagely across his mouth; the heartiness of his
baleful speech may have given him the satisfaction of deep
drink.</p>

<p>I, who alone had heard, tiptoed close behind him, and like
the tempter spoke softly over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“And what may your code be, Mr. Oxford?”</p>

<p>Frightened, he swung, caught his heel on the carpet edge
and thudded heavily against the corner of the age-blackened
mantel, face bleached and eyes popping.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, Mr. Bannerlee,” he exclaimed with much
relief, and attempted to pass his alarm off in jest.</p>

<p>“Yes, and really, what did you mean? I’m interested.”</p>

<p>“What’s my code, you say? Ha, ha, Mr. Bannerlee, ’s too
long, sir, to put it in so many words, if you know what I
mean. . . . But there’s <em>one</em> thing”—for emphasis he dug a
flabby forefinger into my ribs—“<em>one</em> thing I’d never do that
our fine C‑Cosgrove wouldn’t have the decency, the <em>decency</em>,
sir, if y’understand—and the common sense, too, damme, if
it comes to that, you know—’s much common sense in it as
anything else . . . y’understand . . .”</p>

<p>“And what article and section of your pandect could Mr.
Cosgrove learn from?”</p>

<p>Oxford steadied himself, and over his face came a phase
of profundity. He gave me a knowing look, and his voice
sank to a sibylline tone: “Never take another man’s
woman—never meddle with ’em!”</p>

<p>“But a woman unprotected, eh?” I felt like asking, yet
refrained, for someone else was nighing us, one at whose
approach Oxford appeared to feel distressed. The fancy man
evaporated into the afternoon sunlight down the lawn, and
Maryvale, who I think had been standing alone in the centre of
the room, was at my elbow.</p>

<p>That changed look was stronger than ever about him; there
seemed a gaunt and haggard spirit in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bannerlee, you must have heard terrible tales
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Surely none that deserve such a violent—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes—some dreadful things have happened in this
countryside. Cosgrove tells me that this morning he related
to you the fall of the old castle, and in there”—he gestured
toward the dining-hall—“what awful things you must have
listened to.”</p>

<p>I smothered a laugh that was half-breathless, for there was
real distress in him. “Mr. Maryvale, you exaggerate—”</p>

<p>He laid his hand heavily on my arm, and his fingers took
hold. “But there is one story more terrible still!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, indeed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. There are legends of this Vale—none more
appalling. Did they tell you—but they could not—of the Lord
Aidenn’s arm that would not die?”</p>

<p>“The arm that would not die?”</p>

<p>“You know the man’s picture, for you examined it in the
gallery. And there”—he motioned toward the portrait—“is
the other representation of that orgulous, cruel man.”</p>

<p>I stared again at the pitiless, thin face with a slight and
enjoyable stir of nervousness.</p>

<p>“It is a dreadful legend,” averred Maryvale. “They never
found—” He turned his head, saw something, and ceased.</p>

<p>For now came a new interruption, and one that I was right
glad of, since Maryvale just then was too remote and
metempirical for comfort. Of his grisly story of the arm of Sir
Pharamond Kay, whatever the fable was, I had no dread; but in
the baffling Maryvale himself now was something
unapproachable that moved a mild antipathy in me.</p>

<p>The interruption came in the form of a small, hoydenish,
vivid-lipped creature called Lib Dale. The last to remain in
the Hall, save those who had spoken with me, she and Bob
Cullen had been engaged beneath the musicians’ gallery in a
tense-toned division of ideas. Even while Maryvale had been
drawing near me, I caught a glimpse from the heel of my eye
of Bob shuffling his feet in loathness to depart at the hest of
Lib. At length, apparently in disgrace, he had passed limply
through the farther entrance into the corridor. “Go out and
soak your head,” was Lib’s parting tenderness, which I
overheard. Then, spying me with Maryvale, the startling little
thing came to interrupt. The man of business had checked
himself in the midst of his sentence; he seemed to withdraw into
some inner chamber of himself; a darkness enveloped the peaked
soul in his eyes. He was gone, and I was left alone to encounter
the sprightly bit of femininity.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” she asked. “Shake. You’re you and I’m
me. We know each other’s names, or else they shouldn’t let
us out.”</p>

<p>“No, they shouldn’t,” I retorted feebly, without knowing
what I said, save that it was idiotic.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t shed tears about it. Don’t be so vulgarly
emotional. Can’t you dig me up a real live saint, Mr.
Bannerlee—something I can take home maybe and show the folks?”</p>

<p>“I should think that the legends of this countryside—”</p>

<p>“Or a legend, if it’s handier. I’ve never seen a genuine
legend, Mr. Bannerlee. Lead me to it. Hasn’t my education
been neglected?”</p>

<p>I uttered a faint denial.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it has,” she chortled. “For instance, I get my
English all gummed up. But that’s your fault.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t be sil. You don’t know what I mean. For
instance. Have you noticed how all the books you English
writers write about we Amurricans have us saying ‘I guess’
this and ‘I reckon’ that about every once or twice in so often?
Now, over where I come from nobody talks that way so that
you could notice it, but over here in your delightful little island
we have to pull that kind of stuff once in a while or the natives
wouldn’t know where we’re from. Savvy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite.”</p>

<p>She had perched on the back of a carved gilt couch with
upholstery in rose <i>Brocade de Lyons</i>.</p>

<p>“And now how about getting busy on that saint proposition?
One out of the Old Testament or anything. Warm
puppies! won’t I have the kids at home goggle-eyed? I should
snicker.”</p>

<p>“Saints in the Old Testament are few. And I’m afraid—”</p>

<p>“Not so rough, not so rough! What do you mean, you’re
afraid? How will this sound in your biography, that you
refused a maiden’s prayer? I’ll have to take you in hand; you
ought to be trained.” She reached down and gave a tug at a
gravitating stocking. “No, from your face I see it’s hopeless.
Well, what are you going to do to keep the ennui away?”</p>

<p>“I had an idea,” I remarked hopefully.</p>

<p>“Quick, quick! Don’t keep me in starvation.”</p>

<p>“In connection with the method of making up the quarrel
suggested by the good Cosgrove—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I follow you there—everything except the
‘good’—”</p>

<p>“Since the good Cosgrove says that the text of our play of
pacification is in the library, I was thinking of having a look
at it and refreshing my memory.”</p>

<p>“I can follow you there, too; only no refreshments here,
thanks—‘Noah’s Flood’ is all news to me as a big, throbbing
drammer. Sounds sort of frisky, I mean riskay, putting all
those animals to bed. Who wrote it?”</p>

<p>“The authors of the mystery-plays are unknown.”</p>

<p>“Something fishy there, I’ll bet. Come on, show me this
sensation.”</p>

<p>She grabbed a hand of mine and dragged me through the
room of weapons into the spacious library, a room of irregular
shape, since the curve of the staircase well rounded one wall
and the huge jut of the south-west corner tower made a pocket-like
projection almost equal to a separate room. A monumental
mahogany break-front bookcase occupied the principal straight
wall of the room, and other glass-covered stacks of shelves
lined the shorter and the semicircular wall and the spaces
between the windows. Altogether there must have been three
thousand books.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, Croftsy must be some reader,” said Lib. “I was
never here before, and I’ve got a brainstorm already.”</p>

<p>I smiled, wryly, no doubt. “I believe that the library, like
the portraits and the symbol of the cat and the legends of
Aidenn Forest, came to Crofts with the building. In fact,
though I haven’t looked these over, I imagine many of them
are of a sort unlikely to interest our host.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the major portion of the collection were volumes
which could stir the interest only of the antiquarian and
the erudite student of literature. Few, I am sure, bore the
twentieth-century imprint. Included were old books of all
assortments of inconvenient sizes from folio to duodecimo, and
although in their glass prisons, whence no doubt they were
taken and dusted quarterly, they looked spick and span, still
they had a lonesome air, as if longing to be handled for love.</p>

<p>I mused. “Now where shall we look for one particular
volume in all this?”</p>

<p>“Are you putting that as a question, Marshal?” asked Lib.
“That’s not fair. I’m in the enemy’s country here; don’t know
the landmarks.”</p>

<p>“We might look over the ones of reasonable size first. The
thing’s a reprint. Early English Text, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get you, Admiral, but am game to follow you in a
leaky boat to the death. I gathered that this Flood has an
alias.”</p>

<p>“Er—”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t go under its own name, I mean.”</p>

<p>“That is correct.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, you mean. Well, well, Duke, can this be
it?”</p>

<p>She had opened one of the doors of the mahogany case and
reached high from the basis of one toe. The volume she
persuaded to fall down and which she caught was actually a bound
issue of the Early English Text Society and contained the
Digby and Coventry Plays.</p>

<p>“By all that’s wonderful! How did your eyes pick out that
title so quickly?”</p>

<p>“Never looked at the title—way up there. What do you
think I am, Senator, a telescope? Say! I just took a slant along
the shelves.”</p>

<p>“A slant—along the shelves?”</p>

<p>“Right. I thought that maybe the ‘good’ Cosgrove had been
taking a peep at the crucial volume lately and maybe hadn’t
put it back quite even. Savvy? Now, let’s have a look.”</p>

<p>But she wrinkled both nose and forehead from the first sight
of “Processus Noe cum filiis,” and fluttered the pages very much
askance.</p>

<p>“I don’t get this stuff at all. What language is this?”</p>

<p>“English.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s worse than Amurrican.”</p>

<p>“It’s really Middle English, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. See here, what does a choice morsel like this
signify?” She read, in a manner unknown to linguists, the
following lines:</p>

<blockquote class="verse">

  <p>“Ye men that has wifis whyls they ar’ yong,</p>
  <p>If luf youre lifis chastice thare tong:</p>
  <p>Me thynk my heart ryfis both levyr and long</p>
  <p>To se sich stryfis wedmen emong.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That looks as if it might mean something.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Noah was very wroth with his wife.”</p>

<p>“His wife? His missus?”</p>

<p>“She was a scold, and Noah, as the gloss of Professor Pollard
says, bids husbands chastise their wives’ tongues early.”</p>

<p>“Not so hot, not so hot,” remarked Lib, apparently in
disparagement. “Where do all the other folks come in?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’ll be parts for everyone. Noah’s family was large,
and there were plenty of animals to go round. . . . He beats
her a bit later on,” I added hopefully.</p>

<p>She clapped the covers to. “This is too rough for me. It’s
not ladylike. I’m not crazy about—say, what goes on in there?”</p>

<p>Somebody was making a stir in the armoury, whence issued
an occasional scrabbling sound. Lib poked her head cautiously
around the doorpost.</p>

<p>“Why, Doctor, what would you seem to be doing this elegant
afternoon?”</p>

<p>Doctor Aire was standing with a cutlass in one hand and a
claymore in the other. He lifted his gaze from the floor in
surprise and gave an affable welcome.</p>

<p>“Oh, hello. I had no idea anyone else was indoors.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been giving Noah the once over,” said Lib. “What’s
the idea of all the weapons?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see that early battle-axe lying so well protected
out there, if it was chosen for the commission of crime, has
one or two peculiar things about it. It amused me to find
whether—but no, you’d better guess for yourself. I understand
that the subject is taboo just now, and a very good thing.”</p>

<p>Lib stamped with animation. “That’s not a bit nice. This
is such a dull afternoon, and now you won’t even tell us your
secrets.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one,” smiled the Doctor with a sort of saturnine
indulgence. “Feel the weight of these.” He handed over
to her the pair of weapons. “Take a look over the lot.” He
made a sweeping motion to indicate the walls crowded with
arms. “Then think of the axe that lies out there inclosed by
chicken-wire. Then draw your own conclusions.”</p>

<p>Lib poised the cutlas and claymore and returned them.
“Doctor, you’re a whiz. Any more funny little wrinkles?”</p>

<p>“Take your time,” said the doctor. “Examine them all.”</p>

<p>“You give me too much credit,” she declared. “Come on;
what have you found out?”</p>

<p>Doctor Aire gave a slight shrug, one shoulder lifting higher
than the other. It was a mannerism I had observed before.
“Miss Lib, you have all the brains necessary for this extremely
simple point, which I have practically given away already.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a teaser. I’m not a little girl any more, you
know. I don’t <em>like</em> being teased.”</p>

<p>“You must think it out for yourself,” insisted the Doctor,
still smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t; so there! You’re perfectly horrid!”</p>

<p>“Perfection in any wise is seldom gained. I am honoured,”
he murmured, but Lib, tossing her head and departing to the
lawn, in affected dudgeon, probably did not hear the conclusion
of his courtesy.</p>

<p>We laughed together while he replaced the weapons to their
props and fastenings upon the wall.</p>

<p>I looked about the chamber, up the walls crowded with
weapons to the very shadows of the ceiling. Save for the two
full-armoured figures of sheet and mail, most of the equipment
I supposed to be Elizabethan or later, although the Doctor
was sure to be a better judge than I. One gigantic harquebuse <i>à
croc</i> with its support attached dominated the broad wall
between the armoury and the Hall of the Moth; all around it
were muskets, calivers, petronels, dags and tacks, and a couple
of blunderbusses, besides firearms whose names I did not know.
The short wall opposite was full of cutting and crushing
weapons; hence had come the two with which the Doctor had
been experimenting. Between two sets of lances standing upright
for a frame, the eye was mazed in an intricate pattern of
partisans, maces, falchions, hangers, axes, poniards, and, one
might believe, every other size and shape of sticker and slasher
and pounder.</p>

<p>“I suppose you alluded to the heft of the axe we found last
night out there? Its weight is certainly inconsiderable.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the Doctor with a drawl, “it appears to have
been about the lightest object on the wall. Why did he take
that—that hatchet? I’m inclined to think that it was made for
a plaything, not a real working instrument. Odd, its
selection, very odd.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you emphasize the point.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here, where it was taken from, about shoulder
height. Now, assuming naturally that the man who took it
wanted it for business purposes, why didn’t he take this axe
here, something less than a yard further up? There’s real power
in this fellow. Or was the intruder fumbling around in the
dark in a room he wasn’t acquainted with? And then the
blood.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; I have been waiting with interest to hear your
decision there.”</p>

<p>“No decision is possible immediately, if you ask me where
it came from. I have no kit with me, of course. I accept for
the time Pendleton’s assurance that it belongs to the missing
pig, slaughtered in we don’t know what ritualistic manner.
But the position of the blood on the weapon is what annoys
me. You recall it?”</p>

<p>“The handle was slobbered with it.”</p>

<p>“And only a few spots on the blade. That would assure us
the killing was done with the axe, even if the weapon weren’t
so inefficient. Ah!” He lifted his hands in an attitude of dismay,
a stiffish caryatid-like pose. “Pendleton’s right. No good
comes of talking of these things. They’ll unravel. I’m going
to get cleaned up for the rehearsal at five, Mr. Bannerlee. I’ve
been discussing transplantings with old Finlay the gardener,
and my hands have tested some extra fine dirt.”</p>

<p>I saw the Doctor swing his body out of the armoury with
the regularity of an automaton, his trunk stiff and upright,
his narrow legs working like scissors; I heard the Doctor enter
on the winding stair.</p>

<p>Then, alone in the armoury, into which the first faint smoke
of dusk was creeping, among so many instruments of death,
where the intruder of the night before had stolen while the
mockery of cards was in progress in the Hall, and where he
might steal again—there, then, I was not at ease. I had flickers
of apprehension, and the room seemed musty, close. Both
mentally and bodily I felt cabined, confined. More than half an
hour remaining before we were due in the Hall, I resolved
upon taking a light breather up the Vale, to stir my sluggard
blood and puff away my fancies.</p>

<p>No one appeared on the lawn or in the environs of the
House. As I faced north up the Vale a fairish breeze met me
face to face, and I realized that the storm was still in the
atmosphere. The airy armies high above the hills were marshalling
once more. A little while later the sun, not far above the
ridge, was flecked with cloud, and the smouldering embers of
the beechen hangers were, one might say, extinguished to black
ashes.</p>

<p>By the time the glories of colour were lost on the hillsides,
I had reached the clearing beyond which lurked the cottage
of the sisters Delambre. This stood in a gorge-like recess, where
flowed the small stream with the ridiculous bridge which I
had noted when first I journeyed down the Vale. Good, full
inspirations of the untainted air had restored physical tone,
and my thoughts, too, were less troubled, perplexed. I was free
of most of the jangling discord of the day, of Belvoir with his
eternal harping on morals as accidental products, of Ludlow
in his vigilance to combat offensive ideas, of Lib and Bob and
their little bickerings, of Cosgrove and all the enmities that had
heaped around him: Bob’s and the Baron’s and Charlton
Oxford’s, and—almost—the abrupt flaming of the Irishman and
his bride-to-be. That single incident must have impressed the
houseful of us as rudely as a dozen ordinary quarrels of man
to man.</p>

<p>Of the taste of this unpleasantness I could not wholly rid
myself, nor of another thing, which strengthened in the
diminishing of light. This was the witching time of day—and I
could not get away from Parson Lolly.</p>

<p>Well I understood Morgan the stableman when he said that
there were whiles when the “otherness” took hold of one.
Having crossed the clearing, I stood near the cottage of the
French sisters, who, though nothing concerning their characters
had been told me, I conceived must be eccentrics, women so
distant from their nativity, if not in mere statute miles,
certainly in their lives and surroundings. While I looked at the
cottage, a rugged thing of stone, scarcely two stories high,
with roof of hewn stone tiles, as is common hereabout, I thought
it had a deserted and disappointed appearance. It was far too
early, indeed, for even tired farm-women to be abed; yet no
light glimmered through window or cranny. I approached; I
even knocked. No response.</p>

<p>Puzzled, disturbed, I retraced my path.</p>

<p>So feeling, I came in view of Highglen House, all dark and
still on the edge of sunset. I passed beneath the clustered
cypress trees; I traversed the northern span of the lawn and
passed the conservatory with its mended panes. I stepped on
the driveway where it passed the Hall of the Moth, intending
to advance to the front entrance and ring the bell there,
having enough hold on reality, in spite of my fuming blood, to
recall that my own shaving things had been in my bag recently
fetched by Toby, and that with hot water I could quickly
remove the stubble of the day, before the first reading of
“Noah’s Flood” in the Hall of the Moth. At the moment of
my setting foot on the drive, I remember, the faintest sound
of speech wandered to me from somewhere beyond the gate-house.
I could not distinguish any voices, but there seemed to
be both men and women in the party, doubtless returning from
beside Aidenn Water.</p>

<p>Then I chanced to look inside the Hall of the Moth.</p>

<p>Now, now, now is the time when I need to hold each sense
and faculty to accurate account. For what I saw then, what
then I took to be hallucination, now I know too well was
something real, something serious, and something totally
inexplicable to all who have heard of it.</p>

<p>Through the cleft between the eminences of Esgair Nantau
and Vron Hill a single dart from the sun still leaped, lustering
the twilight about the house. A fragment of that glimmer,
about the size of a top-hat but rudely circular in shape, played
and smouldered mild, high on the bare stone of the inner wall
of the room. Except for this wavering spot, dusk had taken
possession of the empty Hall, wherein even the masses of the
furniture were invisible to me.</p>

<p>The chanciest glance took in the gloom of the chamber, but
before I had looked elsewhere, my eyes perceived yet one other
thing distinguishable in the obscurity, and all the blood in me
leaped. To indicate definitely the position of the object, I
should say that to the best of my affrighted recollection it was
just beyond the couch which Lib Dale had mounted earlier in
the afternoon during her talk with me, although the couch
itself, like the rest of the furniture, was now absorbed in the
pool of darkness.</p>

<p>In the air perhaps a foot above the imagined position of the
back of the couch, with no visible means of suspension or
support, was what I can describe only as a clean white bone.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch10">

<h2>X. <br> The Laugh</h2>

<p>A white bone, six inches long, the broadened knobs
at each end a little darker than the rest—horizontal, perfectly
still.</p>

<p>Perhaps I had gazed at this thing in fascination for twenty
or thirty seconds before it stirred at all. Then the faintest
swinging motion seemed to occur, on a horizontal plane, and
suddenly—now my heart was going mad—it rose a couple of
feet as if jerked by a string, and remained motionless once
more, until the swinging recommenced, one end and then the
other moving slightly toward me and away.</p>

<p>The comforting tones of voices had died; it might have
been that I and that apparition were alone in the Vale, a
man and a white irrational bone. I was of no mind to linger
there until the thing should leap up again and drive me into
an apoplexy. And all the while the basis of reason in me was
firm, and there was a voice bidding me quit my folly, for
there could be no bone in the unsupporting air of the Hall.
Yet I did not enter the chamber and get within the same walls
as the apparition; instead I abandoned the place to its ghostly
visitant, hastened around to the front entrance of the House
and rang the bell, although the door itself was unlatched.</p>

<p>I wanted hot water for shaving.</p>

<p>Soames, answering the ring, I met at the foot of the winding
staircase. My voice, I believe, was controlled out of its
excitement when I ordered the water, which he promised to
bring at once.</p>

<p>It was with a doubtful, distracted mind that I entered my
room and caused a tiny apex of flame to glow on the fresh
candles standing at either side of my writing-table. For a
breath of open air, I swung the casement window inward. The
breeze, forerunner of storm, brushed past outside, but no
more than writhed the candle-flames.</p>

<p>I looked out.</p>

<p>As I have stated, my window gives on what I suppose I
must call the balcony, though part of the ancient battlement
stands there in lieu of a balustrade, remnant of an age before
even this room was built and when the top of the wall was
no higher than the window-sill. Odd that the old parapet with
its indentations remained when this lofty course of rooms was
made. This wall above the second storey cut off my view of the
lawn, save where a gap of the crenellation permitted me to look
almost straight down to the drive. Directly below me I now
saw nothing, and far beyond the gate-house towers, rising to
the level of the roof of the mansion, was only the dusky dark
expanse to Aidenn Water. But about the twin-legged
gate-house itself the afterglow lingered in a tiny pool.</p>

<p>I suddenly remembered Crofts’ admonition to have a look at
the tomb on Vron Hill, and my promise that I would. With
an athletic effort I squeezed through my window and stood on
the roof outside. To my disappointment, the sky beyond the
Hill was darkened with clouds whose purple came near to
black. The tumulus was indistinguishable against them.</p>

<p>I moved to the edge of the parapet and leaned over one of
the cops of the crenelled wall for a better look about.</p>

<p>It appeared that two or three people were gathered by the
winch that works the drawbridge and were having great glee
in their endeavours. Rusty metal shrilled, a little cloud of
laughter burst upward, and the huge bridge descended. There
came a thump when the platform settled into place. Then
amid a new little cloud of laughter, the winch set to work
again, and the bridge commenced to rise.</p>

<p>My attention was diverted by something at my feet, the
merest trifle lying at the base of one of the merlons: a twisted
strand which might have been part of a piece of light rope. It
was about the length of my finger-joint, far from fresh, one
end newly abraded, the other decayed. It was, as I said, a
trifle, but it was curious. I could not think then, nor can I now,
how it got there; and certainly the fresh abrasion was not more
than a couple of days old. I had a notion of showing it to
Crofts for an opinion, but when I considered what the energetic
response of our much-tried host might be when asked to
account for a fragment of half-rotten rope, I changed my mind.
But I tucked away the strand for future reference.</p>

<p>One last look up and down the empty lawn, and I slipped
back into my room.</p>

<p>I recalled my shaving, which now must be rapid if I were
to be ready in time for the reading of the play. A few
preliminary preparations made, I ran into an unprecedented
number of mishaps.</p>

<p>I seemed to have an unsteady fit. Soames had not yet come
with the hot water, and I was in a hurry; my watch said a
quarter to five. I made a beginning, however, ridding myself
of my coat and shirt and addressing myself to the oak chest
whereinto I had transferred my things from my bag during
the ten-minute interval before luncheon. But at once I realized
the unsuitability of sixteenth-century appointments for
purposes of personal convenience, for the upper drawer was
jammed or stuck. I hauled, jerked, and jogged sidewise.
Suddenly, bang! came out the drawer, but the handle had parted
from it, and I, handle in hand, staggered back, crash! into a
stool in the corner of the room. When I separated myself
from the stool, and we were both on our legs again, I recollected
that I had tossed my shaving utensils into the drawer of
the writing-table, as being readier to hand.</p>

<p>Then indeed I had a brainstorm, an eagerness for haste
being added to my disquiet of mind. Soames might be there
with the water at any moment, and I not ready. Clutching
razor and strop, I looked in vain for a proper place to attach
the strop; my dissatisfaction with the old room as a place
for personal embellishment was not diminished at all when I
finally chose one of the curlicues of the candle-bracket on the
north wall for a hook. Like the similar one in the armoury,
this was very old, and like the bureau drawer, it seemed
malevolent to thwart me. Holding the strop firmly while my razor
executed loops and pirouettes, I was aghast a moment later,
so suddenly did the fastening of the bracket give way under
the strength of my hold upon the strop. Squeak! went the old,
damp-rotted iron, the candle-holder on its pivot drooped crazily,
and I was staring at the thin red cut beside the finger-nail
where the razor-edge had nicked me. This capped the climax.</p>

<p>It was comedy, no doubt. For me, nevertheless, it was a bad
half-minute. I smashed the bracket back to uprightness; one
blow sufficed, since there had been no fissure in the metal itself.
But my finger could not be cured so cavalierly. And shaving
now was out of the question before five o’clock! Of such
trivialities are wrought either contentment or black spirits.</p>

<p>I chucked away strop and razor and went to the door,
wondering what had become of Soames, and shaking off the drops
of fresh blood from the index-finger of my left hand.</p>

<p>I heard someone coming up the stairs, and at the same time
a peculiar sound of rending rose from the Hall beneath the
threshold where I stood, followed by the loud slam of a door.</p>

<p>I said to myself, “There must be someone in the Hall now,”
but the next instant thought, and all else, was reft from me.</p>

<p>For from some part of the house someone was laughing.
No—to avoid error from the first—I thought then, and at the
present hour this all who heard are willing to swear: the
laughter came from no human throat. Yet is Parson Lolly not
human? And if he—but this shows the inconsistency of our
fear. Yes, I will swear it was no human sound that roared and
re-echoed through the House, gleeing and gurgling, curdling
the blood of us who were within the walls. So huge was the
uproar that the place of its source could not be told, and it
went on and on unendurably for immeasurable seconds, to
change to silence with a sudden gulp.</p>

<p>I dashed to the window for a quick look, and could see
nothing in the darkness, but discovered a glow spreading from
immediately below me. The chandelier in the Hall must be
lighted now. Then flinging my coat on, I rushed out of the
room, impelled by a sense of dread and danger, and an anxiety
to get where people were. I met Soames, hot-water can in
hand, at the head of the stairs underneath the solitary electric
bulb. He was green, a mildewed colour, startled into stone.</p>

<p>I sprang down the stairs without a word, and he,
galvanized, followed with a gasp:</p>

<p>“Gord, sir, is that <em>him</em>?” He meant the Parson.</p>

<p>On the landing of the first floor stood Lib Dale, her fingers
nervously fluttering about her face.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What’s happened?”</p>

<p>“Something drastic,” I said, while we went speeding together
down to the entrance vestibule. Soames, still carrying
the water, brought up a thumping rear.</p>

<p>“Oh, wouldn’t it be awful if someone’s kicked—I mean,
if someone’s been knocked off?”</p>

<p>“Knocked off?”</p>

<p>“I mean if an individual has been assassinated,” she explained
haughtily, and then for an instant her impertinent little face
went to chalk.</p>

<p>We were standing indecisive in the passage. Hardly a minute
had passed since the end of the laughter. A scream suddenly
sounded from the lawn beyond the Hall of the Moth, a cry
of agony which might have seemed terrible had not it been for
that astounding laugh which had preceded it. In its awful
context the scream was pitifully thin and feeble, but it was
human, certainly.</p>

<p>“That’s on the lawn.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Governor,” choked Lib, following me at a half-run
through the gallery-door of the Hall, through the nearest
french windows, and so to the drive.</p>

<p>Beside the small tower near the mended conservatory window
something dark was stretched, with three or four people
about it. While Lib and I were still thirty feet away, we could
tell in the widespread light of the Hall chandelier that a body
lay there.</p>

<p>“It’s a corpse,” cried Lib. “Oh, my God, is it Bobby?” She
rushed forward.</p>

<p>I turned to Soames. “Round up the others, quickly.”</p>

<p>“Y‑yes, sir”; he went back with the ineffable water.</p>

<p>I remember that just as I came up from the lower french
doors of the Hall, Belvoir, crossing the lawn from the direction
of Aidenn Water, arrived at the other side of the group by
the small tower.</p>

<p>He looked down with a curious, contemplative expression.
“This,” he said, “must be the body we missed last
night.” It was not a flippant speech; it seemed to fit the
occasion.</p>

<p>The body lying here, half on the ground, half on the step
to the french window, with Miss Lebetwood kneeling on one
side, Doctor Aire on the other, was Sean Cosgrove’s. Supine
he had fallen, or had been turned, his face bereft of its solidity,
a flabby thing, his eyes closed, and the edge of a bloody wound
showing beneath his left ear, a wound that apparently had a
continuance behind.</p>

<p>With knit brow Doctor Aire let down Cosgrove’s wrist
and shook his head. His thin lips stirred; he muttered:</p>

<p>“It’s no use.”</p>

<p>Miss Lebetwood rose in a paroxysm of pain; she warded off
Alberta Pendleton. In the scattered glow, with hair dishevelled
and eyes afire, she looked like a prophetess of old, pulsing with
authority. With a gesture she put us aside; it was as if she
were putting us out of her thoughts. From us she went, and
disappeared in the vacancy of the lawn.</p>

<p>Pendleton, smitten by a thought, cried “The weapon!” and
dashed into the Hall. We saw him go to the armoury door
and saw the room brighten with electricity. Then the Doctor
and I made the same decision.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch the body,” cautioned the Doctor, and he and
I together followed our host into the room of weapons, among
which he was wildly ranging in a mad search.</p>

<p>“Nothing’s been disturbed here,” observed Doctor Aire.</p>

<p>But Crofts, deaf, continued in his frenzy, drawing every
old rickety sword from its sheath, tearing every weapon from
its peg or stud, rubbing his fingers along the cutting parts.</p>

<p>“Not there, Crofts, not there!” I cried, taking him by the
arm, since speech had no effect.</p>

<p>“Which of these did it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“None,” answered Doctor Aire decisively. “You can see at
a glance—”</p>

<p>“But one of them must have a stain. There couldn’t have
been time to wipe it dry.”</p>

<p>“None are stained,” returned the Doctor. “Come with me.”</p>

<p>He and I had nearly to drag Crofts out to the lawn, to the
spot beyond the gate-house towers where the small axe had
lain covered from the storm.</p>

<p>“But that’s a puny thing!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Doctor, “but even a bullet may do damage,
and the puny axe may have been in the hand of one of
prodigious strength. A light weapon and a heavy blow; it may
have broken the weapon, of course.”</p>

<p>“It will hardly be here, in that case,” I suggested.</p>

<p>We were beside the chicken-wire. There stood Miss
Lebetwood, her white hands clenched against her dark dress.</p>

<p>Her voice was cold, toneless. “I’ve been waiting here,
wondering how long—”</p>

<p>“No matter, Miss,” said the doctor, “we’re here—that’s
what matters.”</p>

<p>I lit a match which managed to keep alive in the stir of
air. The canvas, held down by heavy stones, was in place.
Crofts yanked the sheet away. We gasped.</p>

<p>There lay the small axe, undisturbed. The Doctor stooped
and touched the blood-slobbered handle.</p>

<p>“It’s dry, absolutely. Well, I’m whipped. I’d have sworn—”</p>

<p>We were hastening back to the House almost while the
words were in his mouth. Now there must have been a dozen
guests and servants clustered about the body. I turned to
Crofts.</p>

<p>“Who found him there? Was anything seen? Where was he
killed?”</p>

<p>He was too distracted to pay attention. He was running his
fingers through his mane and whispering little phrases to
himself.</p>

<p>A woman with trembling hands held out some white thing.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Eve Bartholomew. “See what I found when
I came by the end of the House—down there by the large
tower.” She pointed toward the corner round which lay the
main entrance.</p>

<p>“Another—another!” I exclaimed, and Crofts snarled, “It
was time for another, damn his black heart! What does this
one say?”</p>

<p>We read:</p>

<blockquote class="placard">

  <p>LOok OuT foR THe CATS CLAW  PARSON LOLLY</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“The Cat’s Claw! What’s that?”</p>

<p>“How do you expect me to tell?”</p>

<p>“Again we find this damned thing—too late!”</p>

<p>“There’s fresh blood on it!” exclaimed Crofts, taking the
placard from my hand.</p>

<p>“Of course there is, you fool. Look at my finger.”</p>

<p>“How did you do that?”</p>

<p>“Razor.”</p>

<p>Alberta was looking over her husband’s shoulder. “Where
did you find it, Eve?”</p>

<p>“Right at the corner of the House. It was on the grass,
with the writing downward.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said I, “if there’s one thing about this atrocious
deed that I can swear to, it is that there was nothing at that
spot ten minutes ago. I rounded the corner to enter the House
so as to fetch one of the men-servants by ringing the door-bell.
The grass had nothing on it.”</p>

<p>“I was over by the gate-house,” said Bob Cullen, “but I
wasn’t pulling the winch. I was waiting for Lib to come out
again. I was watching the end of the House all the time until
the lights flared up in the Hall. I’ll take my oath, I will, that
nobody went round the corner after Mr. Bannerlee.”</p>

<p>Doctor Aire objected. “But after the chandelier was lit—when
that part of the House and the lawn outside the windows
was bright—you might have overlooked some shadow
slipping along the wall further south.”</p>

<p>Yet this explanation satisfied me no more than it seemed
to quell Bob himself.</p>

<p>“Look here,” Crofts suddenly roared. “Perhaps <em>he</em>—” He
flung out an arm toward the dead man.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“He—himself—”</p>

<p>“This placard was his doing, you think? Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Why not? There was no one else here. That one in his
room this morning: he took <em>it</em> mighty calmly.”</p>

<p>“Sean was not a child, or a fool,” said Miss Lebetwood
coldly.</p>

<p>“Who lit the chandelier?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Ah!” murmured the Doctor, and raised one shoulder higher
than the other.</p>

<p>“Did anyone see him before—this?”</p>

<p>Miss Lebetwood spoke. “I was the first to see him, Mr.
Bannerlee. He was kneeling, I thought, on the step outside
the window—but he must have been—falling. . . .”</p>

<p>“Paula—don’t tell it, dearest,” cried Miss Mertoun.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to tell,” said Paula Lebetwood, still brave,
still vibrant, commanding. “I am not going to break down,
Millicent dear. I—have told of myself. . . . That was all.
He lifted his hand from the stone, as if he wanted to reach
his head—but he fell forward. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“But that unholy bawling laughter—”</p>

<p>“It was from—somewhere else. It wasn’t very loud out
here, but it was what made me look towards the House. Then
I saw—him—while the laugh was still going on. But I didn’t
scream until—afterward, when he fell.”</p>

<p>“The lights were on at the time, of course,” observed
Doctor Aire.</p>

<p>“They had been on for a minute or so, I think,” said Miss
Lebetwood. “But I had paid no particular attention when they
were lit.”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” said the Doctor, “we don’t know where he
was when he was struck. He must have been nearby—couldn’t
have gone far with a bludgeoning like that.”</p>

<p>“Blenkinson, you there?” asked Crofts.</p>

<p>“I am, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have you ’phoned Superintendent Salt at New Aidenn?”</p>

<p>“I ’ave, sir. ’E’s coming, and looking out for hall suspicious
characters on the south road.”</p>

<p>“All right, then.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t the women better go?” asked Ludlow
practically.</p>

<p>“Go in, everybody,” said Crofts.</p>

<p>“Must <em>he</em> be left?”</p>

<p>Doctor Aire said, “Put something under the back of his
head and cover his body with something. I’ll stand guard here.
He can’t be moved until the police arrive.”</p>

<p>“God!”</p>

<p>A bellowing leaped upon us out of the north, a roar that
instead of tailing away mounted higher and higher upon itself.
The wind, which had been bustling, seemed to disintegrate
while the darkness of sound swept through the Vale. Resonant,
tremendous, devastating, the sheer undifferentiated noise bore
down on us, oppressed us with its weight. Brimming the hills,
it actually made the ground tremble. It was nothing like
thunder, but as if something buried alive beneath the earth had
awakened and vociferated horribly. Several of the women
stopped their ears, and there was an awfulness in seeing their
mouths open in screams when the sound was wholly lost in
the roar up the Vale. It was as if they had all gone dumb and
raving. Even when it had ceased at climax, the echoes of the
roar bruited from crag to crag made the Vale alive with sound.
And when the final reverberations had sunk to peace, we
gaped at each other silenced for a little while, even the body of
the man forgotten in the overwhelmingness of sound. When
we spoke, it was in whispers.</p>

<p>“Could that be—thunder?”</p>

<p>“Thunder—like that?”</p>

<p>“It was like Judgment.”</p>

<p>“What was it, then?”</p>

<p>“I can tell you what it was,” I said.</p>

<p>They were round me in a moment, greedy.</p>

<p>“An earthquake?” asked Doctor Aire.</p>

<p>“A landslide—almost an avalanche—on one of the
north-most hills.”</p>

<p>“But what could have caused it?”</p>

<p>“There may have been a condition of incipient instability,
waiting for rain, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“For rain—what rain?” interposed Pendleton.</p>

<p>In answer to him a vast sheet of purple lightning pictured
all the north of the Vale. It vanished, sweeping us into an
instantaneous blacker darkness, but again it glared, and again,
while unmistakable thunders rang. In that dazzling fulgour
the nearby features of the scene were revealed to us as in
bright noontide, but above the Black Mixen, above Mynydd
Tarw, above the other northern peaks, hung a great tower
reaching into illimitable night like a waterfall from heaven.
Again the lightning blazed, and we beheld the hanging shafts,
like sun-pillars among clouds, save that these were black—or
like aerial waterspouts soaring above the earth. And this
stupendous cliff of water was visibly moving toward us, down
the Vale!</p>

<p>Crofts Pendleton turned from the terrific sight, with a
bitter-happy look. He gestured toward the north. In the
effulgence and clamour of the storm he stood like a valiant
pygmy.</p>

<p>“By God,” he shouted, “there’s one direction cut off—for
the fiend who did this!”</p>

<p>“Particularly if the zigzag path has been blocked by the
landslide,” added Belvoir.</p>

<p>“Praise God, the police are coming by the south road. There’s
no missing him if he tries to leave the Vale to-night!”</p>

<p>“Sir Brooke!” cried Eve Bartholomew suddenly. “Sir Brooke!
Where is he?”</p>

<p>“We should all like to know,” said Crofts.</p>

<p>These speeches had been shouts. Now the Doctor made a
megaphone of his hands in order to be heard. In a blaze of
lightning lasting several seconds we saw him hunch his shoulder
and head toward the top of the Vale, whence the rain, white
rain now, and horrible, was pushing back towards us. “This will
be on us in a minute. We can’t leave this poor fellow’s remains
here, regulations or no. We must get the location and position
of the body down in writing at once. I’ll take responsibility.”</p>

<p>Crofts and I stooped to lift by the shoulders and feet
respectively. During our brief act of carrying the corpse into
the Hall and composing it on the couch, the wind suddenly
rose into a mighty strife, and heavy plashing drops of rain
came sousing on the windows. The gale was mad with leaves
from the dishevelled autumn trees, which came knocking on
the panes, clung there for moments like silhouettes, and were
whirled on to their fate.</p>

<p>Crofts stood beside the useless and ironic tea-service, agaze
at the streaming windows. His lips were moving, but I heard no
speech from them.</p>

<p>I moved over beside him. “Who is Superintendent Salt?”</p>

<p>“The best man for detective work in Radnorshire, and
the Chief Constable knows it, they say. Lucky for us Salt
lives in New Aidenn. But he’ll never get here to-night—not
in this deluge.”</p>

<p>Something dashed against the window-pane, and from us came
a stifled cry. Handsome Ruth Clay, who had come in to remove
the tea things, was standing with her fist jammed halfway into
her mouth, her frightened eyes staring to the stormy night.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“See, see! The Bird!”</p>

<p>I followed her look, just in time to see some small dark
object blown before the wind and lost in the howling murk.
“It came up against the window. I saw it.”</p>

<p>“And what of it?”</p>

<p>“It’s the Corpse-bird, sir. It means a death!”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I saw it, sir—no feathers it had—only like the down
of other birds’ wings—and eyes like balls of fire!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, woman. Besides, this Corpse-bird, as you call it,
should have come before. The damage is done already.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, there’s poor Mr. Cosgrove’s body lying there, sir.
But the Bird means another death.”</p>

<h2>XI. <br> Superintendent Salt</h2>

<p class="diarydate">October 4. 2.35 P.M.</p>

<p>Yet the two men from New Aidenn had come up the
Vale through that ruinous rain and wind. From the corner
library window I myself had dimly seen them plodding up the
leaf-stained drive against the blast, and had been at the
cat-head entrance when Blenkinson admitted them, grotesquely
dishevelled by the storm. The very tall one, whose hat was
gone and who carried a bulgy black instrument-case, was
Doctor Niblett, Coroner as well. Superintendent Salt, a man of
more pulp, and built on the underslung plan, wore a necklet
of grizzly beard and had short curly hair, like a Roman
Emperor’s. I at once christened him Peggotty, “a hairy man with a
good-natured face.”</p>

<p>Quite a little lake had sluiced and oozed from their coats
and shoes before Pendleton came rushing downstairs from his
wife’s room.</p>

<p>“You got here?”</p>

<p>“I expect so,” answered Superintendent Salt in the indecisive
way that I have learned is universal with native Radnorites.
“I had my neighbour the Coroner come along, Doctor
Niblett here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes: glad you did. We’ve met, haven’t we, Doctor?
Gad, you look war-shot, both of you. Is the storm so bad?”</p>

<p>“We’ve tramped it from beyond the bridge or thereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Tramped it!”</p>

<p>“Half the bridge was down, Mr. Pendleton. We were
forced to leave the car on t’other side and make a dash over
afoot. The way it looked, Mr. Pendleton, with the water
risin’ so, I doubt you’ve any bridge at all there by now. The
stream’s fair ragin’. And you say there’s been a killin’ here
or something? A guest of yours, maybe? Shockin’.”</p>

<p>“What a day!” cried Crofts fervently. “This way, gentlemen.”
But in the midst of the portrait-corridor, he paused.
“This is murder, and a damned mysterious murder. There’s
been a landslide up the Vale, and that path must be blocked.
Did you pass anyone going south as you came along?”</p>

<p>Peggotty, or perhaps I had better let his name go as Salt,
responded, “We did not, and we have a witness who was by
the bridge since before five o’clock to show that nobody had
been across either way.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a witness?”</p>

<p>“Reliable. The Coroner and I have known him for these
a-many years.” From aloft Doctor Niblett nodded grave
agreement. “Road-mender, he is. Shelterin’ under a tree from
the rain. Had been at work just beyond the bridge, so he
couldn’t have missed seein’.”</p>

<p>Elation seemed to make a dark glow in Pendleton’s soul.
“Then he’s trapped, the dog! That is, if you—did you tell
this witness to watch—?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Superintendent Salt, “that we might be havin’
a look at the body.”</p>

<p>“Er, yes. Yes, of course—I was taking you. I’ll order a
good fire lit at once to help you dry.”</p>

<p>I followed Crofts with the overshadowing Coroner and the
plump Superintendent into the Hall of the Moth. Doctor
Aire and Lord Ludlow were waiting there; the body of Sean
Cosgrove lay on the couch with the <i>Brocade de Lyons</i>
upholstering, and across it was stretched a decorative leather
skin plucked down from the wall.</p>

<p>Introductions were curt. Doctor Aire pulled off the cover,
revealing the corpse. The limbs had been adjusted carefully. <i>Rigor
mortis</i>, of course, had not yet supervened, and the
features, save for the laxity of the jaw, had much the expression
I should have expected to see in untroubled sleep. First Doctor
Niblett bent for his swift, searching preliminary examination,
turning the dead man’s head in his long, large-jointed
fingers. The Superintendent followed in more deliberate
manner, while Niblett went gratefully to the climbing fire.</p>

<p>It appeared that Salt is not one of those master-minds who
require a vacuum in order to get results. He actually began to
function in our presence! For at length, rising ponderously
from his knees, upon which he had been scrutinizing the soles
of the dead man’s shoes, he said, “See here, where’s the
weapon?”</p>

<p>Crofts shrugged his shoulders, having a bit of a flea in his
ear, and Doctor Aire answered, “We haven’t the slightest idea.
There’s a pretty muddle about weapons. We’ve weapons to
burn, but none of them appears to be connected with the case.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go into that later, then. You haven’t disturbed the
contents of his clothing, I see.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>Methodically Salt removed what Cosgrove carried on him
when he died, turning out each pocket when empty and examining
the inside. Besides the loose coins, watch and chain,
and wallet, there were a number of hand-written and printed
sheets in several pockets.</p>

<p>Ludlow singled out one slip from the heap and called Salt’s
attention to it. “This thing,” he said, “was the subject of
some acrimony on the part of the deceased last night. He
accused me, in fact, of pilfering it.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” continued the wily Ludlow, “I had picked the
sheet up somewhere, absent-mindedly, I suppose, and forgotten
about it. It was rather a tense day. But Mr. Cosgrove saw
fit to declare that I had rifled his correspondence—he claimed
it as his, at any rate. Can you make any more of it than I?”</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” asked Salt, who had been
reading it the while.</p>

<p>I fancied a little spite in his Lordship’s tone. “In the light
of events, nothing. Suppose you show it to my friends here.
One of them may suggest some interpretation that will throw
light.”</p>

<p>Crofts was obviously bursting to get a look at the screed, and
I myself was glad of the opportunity to see what else it
contained besides the singular remark about “the mail.” It
commenced without indication to whom addressed:</p>

<blockquote class="document">

  <p class="salutation">“Dear Sir,</p>

  <p>I suppose that I shall see you before long, and we may
  discuss the topic conveniently.</p>

  <p>I must inform you, however, that my principals leave me
  no option in the matter. I hope you will realize your
  untenable and actually perilous position; we do not want your
  brains scattered about. On the evening of my arrival, I
  shall expect a communication from you, stating whether you
  will be amenable. Suppose you leave it in the mail—you
  know where; I’ll come and get it.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I studied the signature for some time before I made it out:
“Lochinvar.”</p>

<p>“And you say that you have no idea what this means?”
asked Salt.</p>

<p>“I wish I did!” responded Lord Ludlow; then, looking
sorry he had spoken with such feeling, he added, “I mean that
if I did, I might see some reason for Mr. Cosgrove’s bursting
into a tirade against me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes?” remarked the Superintendent dryly, and turned
to Crofts. “I suppose you couldn’t tell when this was delivered?”</p>

<p>“Not while he was here,” returned Crofts promptly. “The
only delivery is at eleven, and I sort the mail myself. Cosgrove
never got any.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we must show it to the others in the house
and see if anyone recognizes the hand.” Salt stood pondering
a moment, then braced with decision. “And now I think that
I’ve heard enough puzzling odds and ends about this crime. I
want somebody to tell the story of it right straight through,
so I’ll get the tit-bits in their proper places.”</p>

<p>This was clearly for Crofts, and I did not envy him. I
remember that the rest of us were going to depart when Salt
retained us with a gesture. So we were part of the audience
while our host, with much nervousness and with some little
assistance from the rest of us, told who were in the House,
and what, in the main, had happened until the time Blenkinson
had rung up the New Aidenn police station at
five-twenty-two.</p>

<p>Only once did the Superintendent put in a word. Crofts had
been setting forth as well as he could our bodily dispositions
after we had left the Hall of the Moth. “So none of us could
have been near him, and there’s no trace of anyone else. And
there you are, Superintendent.”</p>

<p>“Oh—ah—um,” remarked Salt, his eyes moving about the
walls. “Secret passages?”</p>

<p>“None,” snapped Crofts.</p>

<p>“Go on, sir, please. This is very interestin’.”</p>

<p>When our host had finished, Salt emitted a noise both gruff
and complacent.</p>

<p>“A pretty job,” he observed. He cast a look about the room,
as if the atmosphere of the Hall of the Moth impressed him
for the first time, and he gave a conscious shiver. I saw his
eyebrows twitch for a moment when his glance fell on the
iniquitous portrait of Sir Pharamond on high. “A pretty job
and will take a lot of doin’, I expect.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to see the rest of us now?” asked Crofts.
“The party is waiting in the conservatory.” He indicated the
door with a nod.</p>

<p>The Superintendent regarded the corpse with lack-lustre
eye, and pulled his beard reflectively. “N‑no, not to-night, if
you please. Not now, thanks. I’ll take ’em all in the morning.
As a plain fact, there’s too much blood-and-thunder in the
atmosphere to-night. Keeps people from thinkin’ straight. And
we can’t catch the murderer to-night, anyhow.” He paused a
moment, blinking thoughtfully again; he was given to these
interludes of cogitation. “But see here; we may clear this
matter up.” He showed the “Lochinvar” letter. “I’ll just pass
this round and see if anyone twigs the writin’.”</p>

<p>“This way, then,” ushered Crofts. He preceded us into
the conservatory with its great windows, where the company
was sitting in little breathless groups of twos and threes.</p>

<p>Only Maryvale lingered alone, beyond the grand piano, his
fingers sometimes very lightly pressing the keys in chords of
some neutral mode, neither major nor minor.</p>

<p>Salt explained that he intended to ask but one question just
then, alleging anxiety lest anyone should be overwrought in
the situation of time, circumstance, and weather. He gave an
uneasy look at Maryvale, whose chords seemed to deepen the
sombreness of the rain-beleaguered room. The “Lochinvar”
letter went the rounds, until it reached Eve Bartholomew beneath
a large potted plant whose leaves were like donkeys’ ears.
She gave a pleased cry, then a gasp.</p>

<p>“Sir Brooke wrote this! . . . But what does it mean!”</p>

<p>“Never mind what it means, Ma’am,” said Salt. “And who’s
Sir Brooke? Not here, is he?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember?” Crofts asked. “He’s the
missing—”</p>

<p>“Idiot,” murmured Ludlow, and went on to say: “I haven’t
known our infirm absentee as long as this good lady, and his
writing is unfamiliar to me, but it surprises me greatly that he
signs himself ‘Lochinvar.’ Curiously unfit I should say. Madam,
was that one of his baptismal names?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bartholomew bridled. “I have no doubt Sir Brooke
had good reason to sign himself any way he thought proper.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt either,” acquiesced Ludlow, and added the
remark, “Don Quixote.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t eaten yet?” Salt asked.</p>

<p>Our host ejaculated, “Hardly!”</p>

<p>“Suggest you do, then, and everybody try to get some rest.
All doors locked, windows latched. No danger now, of
course—only never give temptation.”</p>

<p>“This way, then, if you’re for food,” bade Crofts, and led
the way into the dining-room, where he himself was to make a
wretched job of eating.</p>

<p>The conservatory emptied slowly. A few people followed
Crofts; perhaps two-thirds of men make for the stairs and the
cold comfort of their bedrooms. At the bottom of the well
I drew Miss Lebetwood apart from Mrs. Belvoir. Then, I
confess, I felt ashamed, and spoke awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Miss Lebetwood, forgive me if I—that is, I hope you won’t
mind—if you don’t want to answer—”</p>

<p>Her voice was quite controlled. “Yes, what’s the matter,
Mr. Bannerlee?”</p>

<p>“It may not have anything to do with this awful—”</p>

<p>“What do you want to know, Mr. Bannerlee?”</p>

<p>“You remember telling how Miss Mertoun—before she
wandered out last night—how she said something about its
being ‘his music’? Well—”</p>

<p>Paula Lebetwood winced and said, “You want to know
what that meant?”</p>

<p>“It’s rather stuck in my mind, you see—and I thought—”</p>

<p>“You’re not a detective, are you, Mr. Bannerlee?”</p>

<p>“Why—no—I—”</p>

<p>“Your name <em>is</em> Bannerlee, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Miss Lebetwood.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me; it was rude. But I am so tired—and your
question—”</p>

<p>“Please don’t—”</p>

<p>She interrupted, but her hesitation had become as great as
mine, and there was certain displeasure in her tone. “Excuse
me, I beg you, but I—don’t—think I want to tell you, Mr.
Bannerlee. I can hardly call it my—secret, you know.”</p>

<p>“Pray excuse <em>me</em> for asking. But you may be called on to
tell to-morrow. It will be painful, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope I won’t have to. Really—really, it has nothing
to do with—”</p>

<p>She fled up the stairs, and I, full of musing, went into the
dinner-room and tried to eat. But it was no use then. I
excused myself from the group about the table (pale, they were,
as if Death itself had taken a seat at the board) and slowly
proceeded to my second-storey room.</p>

<p>I wrote in this diary, and while I wrote I heard slight sounds
below. Not until a long time later, when hunger had at last
made itself felt and I hoped to burgle the larder, and stole
down near midnight—not until then did I realize the full
import of those sounds. While I passed through the corridor to
reach the dining-room door and thence the kitchen, the far
entrance of the Hall opened, and an unusual glare of light burst
forth. Doctor Aire stood on the threshold. He wore a cook’s
white apron tied beneath his arms and pinned to his trousers
below the knees. He was rubbing his fingers on the edge of it.
Using the instruments of the tall, wordless Coroner, he had
just performed the superfluous but required necropsy upon the
body of Sean Cosgrove.</p>

<p>“The blow on the neck did it; nothing else the matter. He
had a whale of a constitution.”</p>

<p>Aire, too, was hungry. But it almost robbed me of my
appetite again to see him eating with those gruesome fingers.</p>

<p>As the Superintendent foresaw, it was well that the <i>post-mortem</i>
was quickly done. After all, we were cut off from
escape. The bridge was wholly gone; so we had already learned
by telephone. Burial of the murdered man somewhere in the
Vale might yet be necessary. The King-maker entombed alone,
uncoffined, far removed from the odour of sanctity!</p>

<p>Aire, Salt, and I came up together at half-past eleven.
Poor Crofts had been troubled enough about finding places
for the two officials overnight. On the first floor the rooms
were filled: the Belvoirs, Oxford, and Miss Lebetwood take
up the left portion of the storey not part of the upper reaches
of the Hall, and on the other side the Pendletons, the Aires,
Bob Cullen, Ludlow, and Miss Mertoun have rooms. Above
these the only habitable chambers are those of Maryvale, Mrs.
Bartholomew, and Lib at the south end, and mine up the
passage. Between my room and Lib’s are two chambers filled
with stores of oddments anything up to a century old. The great
rooms across the passage from me are also depositories and
magazines of much that has been undisturbed since long before
Crofts bought Highglen House.</p>

<p>I knew that our host took Salt and Niblett over the House
in a sort of preliminary inspection about ten o’clock, for they
arrived finally at my antique domicile. Crofts, thoughtless oaf,
had given me no warning, and I was nearly caught in the
exercise of pen and ink. I contrived, however, to thrust my
writing-book underneath the table and to snatch a piece of
notepaper. I was inditing a letter when the Superintendent
looked in.</p>

<p>Then they stood in the doorway and discussed
sleeping-quarters.</p>

<p>“Disadvantages every way,” complained Crofts, “whether
you try the ground floor, the first, or the second—but of course
I forgot—there’s no place available on the first.”</p>

<p>“The first floor will do us very well,” said Salt.</p>

<p>“Eh? What do you mean? You surely don’t mean—”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cosgrove’s room? Yes. Dr. Niblett and I will divide
the sleepin’ there and beside the corpse.”</p>

<p>Cosgrove had occupied the east-projecting room furthest north
in the older body of the House. Miss Mertoun’s, beyond it, is
above the newly-built conservatory, and since, as I may have
said, the conservatory does not extend the entire width of the
house, Cosgrove’s room juts out, making a notched corner at
that end of the mansion.</p>

<p>“But surely—”</p>

<p>“I’m leavin’ my superstitions out with my boots to-night,”
observed Salt solemnly.</p>

<p>“But why not carry the body up there? I’ll have a bed
made—”</p>

<p>Crofts gave it up after a while, though I am sure that not
for a king’s ransom would he himself last night have occupied
the narrow chamber that had been the Irishman’s. The voices
became faint down the passage; the last I heard was Salt’s
diminishing assurance.</p>

<p>“I took the liberty of usin’ your telephone. I gave the Chief
Constable a stiff surprise. There are two of the county
police—”</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch12">

<h2>XII. <br> Noah’s Flood</h2>

<p class="diarydate">Same day. 8.30 P.M.</p>

<p>And now we know that the Chief Constable has left
the direct handling of the case to Salt, under a discreet
supervision from afar. Wise of the Constable, since he had no hope
of reaching the storm-bound house!</p>

<p>By chance at the bottom landing I met Millicent Mertoun.
I thought her more lovely than ever, though the terrors of
the day before had altered her cheeks to something like the
hue of wax. But her inexpressible dark eyes glowed with
undimmed fascination. She smiled, courageously, I imagined.</p>

<p>“It’s terrible, isn’t it, Mr. Bannerlee, to have to eat when
everything is so awful? But I’m hungry, really. I couldn’t
take a bite last night.”</p>

<p>I sympathized.</p>

<p>“Have you heard anyone speak of finding a scarab, quite a
small scarab?”</p>

<p>“I’ve just come down myself this morning, you see; so, of
course— But perhaps I can help you look for it. Whereabouts
do you think you lost it?”</p>

<p>“It’s not mine—it’s Paula’s. She won’t tell anybody about it,
of course, because it’s so unimportant compared with . . . She’s
troubled about it, though. It’s an heirloom, I believe, from
someone of her family who was in Egypt.”</p>

<p>“I shall have a look for it, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s no use looking, thanks, unless someone’s
just happened to pick it up. It was a tiny scarab, set in a ring,
and it probably came loose outdoors.”</p>

<p>“Outdoors!”</p>

<p>“Yes, she didn’t notice it was gone until after—after—”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, Miss Mertoun, I’ll let you know in case
anyone mentions such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you. But don’t say I told you.”</p>

<p>The straggling procession into the breakfast-room was not
merely a subdued but even a sorry lot. Dismay and hunger
both had been at work on most of us. Few, I believe, had slept.
I myself had, but it was a sleep tossed and pulled by past and
future. Food, however, worked its customary melioration, and
when at ten o’clock we were summoned to meet Salt in the
conservatory, scarcely anyone looked the worse for the mental
battering of the day before. I suppose Crofts Pendleton was
actually the hardest hit.</p>

<p>It transpired that Salt had already been about the grounds,
rain-infested as they were. Insulated in rubber, he had
examined the site of Cosgrove’s death, seen the canvas-covered
axe, and made a tour of the immediate environs of the house.
Already, too, he had concluded an intensive search in
Cosgrove’s room and among his belongings, and to that room the
unlucky Irishman’s body had lately been conveyed, which
relieved some of the gloom in the Hall of the Moth. Now, with
the Coroner of few words seated beside him, the Superintendent
stood watchfully in the sinus of the piano while we filed
into the undertakers’ Elysium. The servants were already
standing hangdog along the wall.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to interview each of you separately, ladies and
gentlemen,” Salt announced. “But I must really get acquainted
a bit with you first, and have your names down. So, if you
please, I’ll just ask each of you in turn to tell who you are
and what brought you—I mean what association you’ve had
with Mr. Pendleton here.”</p>

<p>At this moment Blenkinson took the centre of the stage
without a cue. “If I may hinterpose, sir, I ’ave in my pocket
a very comprehensive document, I may call it, which will
simplify your task considerably.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, for God’s sake?” exclaimed Crofts.</p>

<p>I am sure that the butler never had so many heads looking
at him before, but with the coolest air he produced from his
tail-pocket a sheaf of papers, and smoothed them lovingly.</p>

<p>Blenkinson was balancing a pince-nez on the bridge of his
nose. “With your permission, sir, I will read. Hm! Hrrum!”
He teed off and began.</p>

<p>It proved that the butler the evening before had assumed
the rôles of despot and inquisitor in the world below stairs, and
had then been my serious rival for honours in composition.
Blenkinson read loudly in a high, thin voice, a woeful torture
to the ear, his eyes behind the pince-nez bulging whenever he
licked his thumb to turn the page. The screed he unfolded to
the gaping company began with a preamble and concluded with
a peroration, and must have been a couple of thousand words
long. It was a vindication of the servants’ hall against base
suspicion in the matter of the late demise of Sean Cosgrove.</p>

<p>The evidence was in a sort of interlocking system. From the
time Crofts had dismissed his court of inquiry after luncheon,
until the hideous laugh that emanated from we don’t know
where, the whole baker’s dozen of servants were accounted for
and quite removed, I should say, from the province of
investigation.</p>

<p>The boy Toby had been outside the kitchen entry peeling
potatoes and onions all afternoon, on promise, vain, as it proved,
of being let off at night for semi-bucolic revelry in New Aidenn.
With him for half the time were Jael and Em, the maids,
who according to the condensed economy of the house always
joined in the “parin’s and dishin’s.” When released from
knives and vegetable-baskets, they resorted to the room of their
companion Harmony, whom they awoke from snores, and the
trio proceeded to improve the afternoon with gossip. Rosa and
Ruth Clay could testify to the earlier snoring of Harmony;
under the eye of Blenkinson they had then prepared tea, had
early wheeled the tea-table, minus tea and hot water, into the
Hall, and had gone to the stables for a bit of genteel chat with
Morgan. From then until the catastrophe they vouched for
him, as well as for the other stablemen, who were moving about,
momently in and out of sight, over one hundred feet from the
place of Cosgrove’s death. The jealous eye of Ardelia Lacy,
too, herself seen in and seeing from Alberta Pendleton’s
window, corroborated the Clays; she had come down and was
sipping tea in the kitchen at the moment of the attack upon
Cosgrove. Soames polishing silver until he answered my ring,
and old Finlay pottering about in the flower-beds, were amply
vindicated. Even Hughes the keeper was accounted for in
Blenkinson’s compendium, for there was plenty of evidence
that he had been in his room mending a refractory gun for
three solid hours.</p>

<p>That gives a faint idea of the method of Blenkinson’s
“document”; it does not begin to do justice to the detail and
close-meshed cogency of it. The servants, severally and
individually, are out of the investigation. For my part, I never
for a moment considered the implication of any of them could
be other than mad.</p>

<p>Blenkinson, however, had done more. He had unearthed
one or two bits of evidence that may be valuable. Of these
I shall relate one, leaving the other until the problem
occurred of checking Cosgrove’s whereabouts after he followed
Miss Lebetwood from the Hall of the Moth.</p>

<p>Very early indeed yesterday morning Jael, polishing the
kettle, sat at the window by the door leading from the kitchen
along the passage to the servants’ rooms. In her carefreeness
she was singing a measure, when her eye caught movement in
the kitchen-garden near the chicken yard. A strange man,
“shaped like a lump,” was prowling there. She opened the
window, shouted warning to the stables; the invader uttered
a short heathenish exclamation and ran away toward the head
of the Vale. The men later found his footmarks in a
carrot-bed.</p>

<p>Strange to say, there had been no inclination on the part of
the servants to assign the attributes of Parson Lolly to this
interloper. Perhaps the fact that he left footprints robs him
of the distinction. Instantly, however, I recognized in him the
gorilla-man I had encountered in the twilight when entering
the Vale for the first time. Probably Jael saw him seeking
breakfast.</p>

<p>Blenkinson concluded with a peroration the essence of
eloquence, pleased with himself as an old stager applauded on
his return at sixty in the part of Romeo. For our lively buzz
showed that the butler had stimulated us out of our moroseness,
made us forget ourselves, even in that rainy, melancholy
morning.</p>

<p>“Priceless,” I heard Belvoir chuckle, and our harassed host
unbent so far as to smile, whereas Lib Dale forgot the solemnity
of the occasion in open chortling. Lord Ludlow muttered
something about “probably a stickit minister.” As for the
servants, they seemed to be in a stupor of admiration.</p>

<p>Whatever Salt may have thought of Blenkinson’s taking
evidence behind his back he kept it to himself. Reaching over,
he grasped the document about to disappear into the coat-tail
pocket once more, and placed it in his own inner pocket
instead.</p>

<p>“Very interestin’,” he remarked. “Now I’m fully informed
on that subject. I could pick out every one of you,” he said
to the servants, “when Mr. Blenkinson here alluded to you.
You’re all excused for the present.” He turned to the guests.
“But I’m not clear yet about all of you ladies and gentlemen.
You first, Mr. Pendleton, though. How long, now, have you
owned this place? I seem to recall it’s about two years.”</p>

<p>“It is, just.”</p>

<p>“And did you know Mr. Watts that was here before you?”</p>

<p>“No, Superintendent, I did not. The House was an unsold
portion of old Watts’ estate. It must have been five years after
his death that I negotiated for it. . . . Wish to God I hadn’t
heard of it,” he appended under his breath.</p>

<p>“That was all my fault, old fellow,” consoled Alberta
Pendleton.</p>

<p>“This furniture and the pictures, now, eh?”</p>

<p>“Everything came with the House. Library of books, tooled-leather
style—storerooms full of odd stuff, costumes and furniture,
crocks mostly—but we did find a fine Buhl bureau buried
among some stacks of Victorian newspapers, and dragged it
out. There was a little of everything in the attics. He must
have been a prime scholar and collector, old Watts.”</p>

<p>“A little of everything, you say? What do you mean, Mr.
Pendleton?”</p>

<p>“Cheese-parings and candle-ends: trash, you know. Some
queer pieces though. Old Watts must have rowed for his
college, or with some club, when he was a youngster. There
were oars and other boating paraphernalia in one of the
rooms—so much of it we expected to find a shell entombed.
I ran across equipment there for a parlour magician—quite
elaborate. We were hoping Doctor Aire would give us a
show with it only yesterday. And—well, I’ll take you through
the lot, if you like.”</p>

<p>“Yes, please.” Salt addressed Alberta. “<em>You</em> hadn’t known
Mr. Watts? You spoke just now—your fault, you said—”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I meant that Crofts bought the place because
I preferred it to any other we inspected. It was so out-of-the-way.”
She drew the silk scarf about her shoulders closer, as if
she were cold. “But that makes it all the more horrible now.”</p>

<p>“Who were the solicitors?”</p>

<p>Crofts told him.</p>

<p>“And by the way, Mr. Pendleton, what is your line of
business? You, er, are in business, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered our host briefly. “Drugs. Manchester.”</p>

<p>I knew that after this preliminary survey, the Superintendent
would interview us separately on the events of the fatal
afternoon.</p>

<p>He chose to commence with Maryvale. Salt held the door
open for the man of business to pass through, entered himself,
and carefully closed the door. It was with a kind of misgiving
that I watched them disappear, for now began the really
crucial part of the investigation, the ascertainment of precise
times and places, the attrition of fact against fact, and the
weighing of hypotheses. And I was not at all sure that I fancied
Salt, any more than I had last night in the beat of the rain.</p>

<p>The rain continued. The servants had gone, of course, and
now the taciturn Coroner departed to catch up sleep in
Crofts’ room; so we were an intimate group once more. But
the blight of cheerlessness had fallen on us again, and mystery
reached its wings of fear about us. The mutter and hiss of
rain sometimes redoubled at the vast windows, sometimes sank
to a whisper, and those windows from their very size, seemed
to admit a darker darkness. Hardly a word was spoken, and
that not always heeded.</p>

<p>It was a quarter of an hour before Salt appeared with Maryvale.
The official tugged at his border of beard with somewhat
dubious expression. It was not hard to imagine that Maryvale
had proved an unsatisfactory answerer, now that this strange,
detached fit was upon him. Salt nodded to Alberta Pendleton,
who passed through the doorway. Maryvale without a word
took the piano-seat she had vacated, and began softly to play
his sequences of brooding, atonic chords.</p>

<p>The inquiry progressed behind the closed door. Some of
us Salt detained only a couple of minutes, persons who could
merely verify, but not add to the information already at
his disposal; others were with him twenty minutes or more.
Among these I was.</p>

<p>“I don’t think—ah, yes, now I seem to remember. You’re the
gentleman who had a nasty fall or something. Well now, do
you mind tellin’ me how you happened to get here, and if
you know anything about this case?”</p>

<p>I suppose that I was able to tell him more than anyone
else. I decided then to give my information without stint,
since it was not the sort of thing that could possibly benefit
mankind by concealment, and it might even speed Salt on
the track of his theory. I recounted every incident I have
here set down: the search for St. Tarw’s devotional site,
the bull, the gorilla-man, the menagerie-keeper, the winking
window, his Lordship in the armoury, and whatever else did
not merely coincide with other evidence. I did <em>not</em>, however,
allude to this diary. Salt, by the way, did me the great honour
of hearkening without gasp or demur to my story of the tall,
bulgy man with the Paul Pry-Schubert umbrella.</p>

<p>In the end he reverted to the matter of the saint’s oratory.
“This ruin or something you were lookin’ for, now. Maybe I
could give you a feeler for findin’ it.”</p>

<p>I said that he was very kind, that when I set forth from
London the task had seemed dubious, and now the death of
Cosgrove had driven my hobby well-nigh out of my mind.</p>

<p>“You’ll soon get over that, I expect,” he encouraged heartily.
“Now, I’m none of your experts on old stones or old codgers,
of course, and I never did hear of the party you mention,
but when I was a boy I had a good share of climbin’—aye,
and of fallin’—in Aidenn Forest. I can mind once runnin’
across something that sounds like your whatnot. By gummy,
sir, if I don’t think I could guide you there yet!”</p>

<p>And forthwith he gave me a series of directions, which he
insisted I take down. However interested I should have been
in these two days ago, now among grimmer things the project
of finding the oratory seems trivial, seems superfluous. But I
jotted down what he told me, thanked him, and returned to
the conservatory.</p>

<p>The spark of speech had been fanned into life during my
absence. They were talking of the events of the day before—what
else could they?—but they had happened upon a particular
and engrossing phase. No longer, as all last evening, did
they repeat to each other what they themselves had done; they
had been over that so many times, all to no purpose. When,
like me, each had given his account of the afternoon, it was
evident that none of them could possibly have been concerned
in the death of Cosgrove, or even could have seen the manner
of it.</p>

<p>Where, as a fact, had they been after the moment of the
Irishman’s disappearance through the shrubs among which
Paula Lebetwood had fled? Well, no one had remained long
in the House. The Pendletons and the Belvoirs, together with
Mrs. Bartholomew, had formed a party for a walk and had
gone south. Avoiding the road, they had made their way
through park-like portions of the estate all the way to the
bridge, to marvel at the volume of Aidenn Water there. Far in
the distance beyond the bridge, they had seen the road-mender
working his long hours. Ludlow and Miss Mertoun had struck
off for a stroll where Aidenn Water makes considerable of a
bend beneath the western hills. Bob Cullen, feeling wretched
after his dismissal by Lib, had gone alone the opposite way,
kicking a disgusted trail in the turf past the stables and on
beyond to where the steeply-wooded slope of Whimble Hill
commenced. After her departure in dudgeon from the armoury
(and from Doctor Aire and me) Lib had gone outside to look
vainly about the grounds for Bob, then had come in to find
Miss Lebetwood, but had encountered me on the stairs
instead. Dr. Aire, having washed his hands free of gardener’s
loam, immediately went out, chanced upon Maryvale in the
tiny grove of cypress trees, and sauntered up the Vale with
him. The men turned off the path to approach the eighteenth-century
summer-house, upon whose rotting steps they sat for
a half an hour. Incidentally, they saw me wandering toward
the deserted farm of the sisters Delambre, and saw me
returning therefrom.</p>

<p>Oxford had spent the most peaceful afternoon of all: seating
himself in the shade of the gate-house to smoke a cigarette,
he had gone to sleep in good earnest. Awakened by a sound,
he discovered Miss Mertoun, Ludlow, and Belvoir amusing
themselves by turning the winch of the drawbridge. Belvoir,
having left his wife and the others below for a brisk walk
back along the stream, had met Miss Mertoun and his Lordship,
and had suggested the pastime. By now Bob Cullen had
made a broad circuit of the House, and stood aloof somewhat
churlishly, refusing to be beguiled by the action of the
drawbridge.</p>

<p>My report of my own doings, told at breakfast, and including
as it needs must the impossible bone, had met a polite
but agnostic reception. The table had lapsed into nervous
silence. Ludlow, tapping his pince-nez on one knee crossed
over the other, stared out the eastern window with a crinkly
smile.</p>

<p>“The mystic bone!” he murmured ironically. (The epithet
has stuck.)</p>

<p>“What are you suggesting, Lord Ludlow?” I asked
brusquely, for my feathers were perhaps a little ruffled.</p>

<p>“I should say you needed to have your sight examined.”</p>

<p>“It has been, recently, and pronounced excellent.”</p>

<p>“Then why not consult our friend Doctor Aire, professionally?
He has had something to do with mental cases.”</p>

<p>I was going to retort when Alberta’s even tones admonished
me “not to notice his nonsense or he’d get vain”; so I
let it go at that.</p>

<p>As for Miss Lebetwood’s hour before the tragedy, she had
soon relaxed her pace among the strawberry trees, and the
wave of anger had ebbed away. She found herself nearby the
tennis court. Feeling, she said, very much ashamed of her lack
of self-control, she postponed returning to the House as long
as possible, and began to search industriously for some of
the lost tennis balls. She failed to recover a single one,
and at length, noticing that the planted grove was becoming
thick with twilight, and glancing at her wrist-watch, she
realized that she must hasten back to the House unless she were
to miss tea, and appear more ungracious than ever. She did
not, of course, know of the plan to rehearse “Noah’s Flood,”
for neither Cosgrove nor anyone else had she seen. Aire had
spied her just emerging from the thickets to the lawn. From
the time of her outburst against him, she was not to see her
betrothed again until, when half-way across the lawn a few
rods above the gate-house, she saw him kneeling, as she thought,
and dying, as it proved, beside the small tower.</p>

<p>All this, certainly, was threadbare to tell by this morning;
backward and forward the courses had been traced until there
was disgust at the <em>resultlessness</em> of it all. But now I returned
from Salt to find a new problem had arisen in the company.
Miss Lebetwood (who with Millicent Mertoun was now engaging
in the last of Salt’s private conferences) had said that
since Cosgrove had not found her by the tennis court, it was
extremely unlikely that he had ever looked for her at all; and
once she had uttered these words, every person in the
conservatory was acutely aware what a <i>non sequitur</i> yawning lies in
the seemingly harmless assumption that because a man stares
hard and plunges into some bushes he is of necessity searching
for something beyond those bushes. Well then, what <em>had</em>
Cosgrove been doing, and where, from leaving the Hall until
receiving his death-blow by the tower?</p>

<p>In vain we attempted to make out for him an itinerary which
would account for the afternoon. All that the united company
could supply was one fact sandwiched between two uncertainties,
and even that fact had been offered by the servants’
hall. I may record the items thus:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>First uncertainty: Doctor Aire, who left me alone in the
  armoury a good quarter of an hour after Cosgrove departed
  from the Hall, says that before seeing Maryvale, he caught
  a glimpse of what may have been a human face among some
  dogwood shrubs a little to the right of the cypress grove.
  But whether it was Cosgrove’s face, or that of an intruder,
  or “the prodigious Parson’s” (who is so familiar that he
  seems no intruder), or whether it was no face at all, Aire
  refuses to commit himself. He seems rather inclined to believe
  himself the victim of an illusion. The scientific mind, I
  suppose. (Query—Could <em>this</em> have been the gorilla-man?
  If so, we have the first evidence to substantiate any definite
  person’s presence about the time and place of Cosgrove’s
  death.)</p>

  <p>Fact, from Wheeler, the youthful chauffeur, via
  Blenkinson’s document: Cosgrove beckoned to Wheeler from
  behind a corner of the garage at about ten minutes past four.
  Answering the signal, Wheeler had been conducted to a
  place out of sight among the decaying stonework. (Stables
  and garage occupy part, but not all the site of the ruined
  south-east portion of the castle.) “I want no one to
  overhear us,” said the Irishman, “and I want you to keep
  eternally silent about what I am going to say.” For emphasis he
  placed a pound note in Wheeler’s hand. “There will be five
  more for you at the end of my stay here if you do what
  I bid you and hold your tongue.” Wheeler swore eternal
  fidelity, and Cosgrove gave his orders. “It’s almost nothing
  I want. To-night there will be a foolish entertainment in the
  House, and everyone will have the costume of an animal.
  The costumes, I know, are in the storerooms on the second
  floor. Now, I have a friend who must enter the House to
  me without anyone being the wiser. He can come in during
  the mummery if he has the appearance of an animal, and
  I want you to see that he finds his costume. You know my
  room?” Wheeler said he did not, and Cosgrove explained
  that he occupied the room next the inner conservatory wall.
  “The tower there juts out corresponding to the one on the
  other side between the Hall of the Moth and the conservatory.
  At a quarter past nine I shall drop the costume from
  the tower window; it will be an extra progeny for the
  elephant, or some such vanity. I want you to be on hand from
  the time I mentioned until my friend comes a little later, and
  I want you to see that he gets into the costume and into the
  Hall, where the performance begins about ten. My friend
  will also come beneath my window, but I shall no longer
  be in my room; so you must be there to meet him.” Wheeler
  guaranteed satisfaction, and was sure that he and Cosgrove
  had not been seen during this colloquy. (Nor had they been,
  but they had been heard. Morgan, overhauling a saddle in a
  harness-closet just beyond the wall, could verify the tones
  of the men’s voices, but had distinguished none of the sense.
  In vain, later, he tried to wrest Wheeler’s secret from him.)</p>

  <p>Second uncertainty: Belvoir believes, but is not prepared
  to swear, that just as he and Miss Mertoun and the Baron
  approached the gate-house from the direction of Aidenn
  Water, he saw Cosgrove on the lawn. Two things make
  Belvoir doubt if he actually did see the Irishman or not.
  First, he was talking about and thinking about something
  else at the time, and the sight was no more than a surface
  impression, so to speak, on his mind. Furthermore, he may
  have been tricked by the twilight, for the huge shadow of
  the gate-house reached across the lawn just there, even
  ascending the wall of the House part way. If he saw the
  Irishman in the shadow, the image must have been extremely
  vague, for not only is the distance considerable from where
  the three were walking, but Cosgrove, it must be borne in
  mind, was wearing a black coat and dark blue breeches.
  Belvoir is extremely uneasy on the prongs of his dilemma.
  (Those with him saw nothing.) Asked what position Cosgrove
  was in, he answers curiously enough that if he saw the
  Irishman at all, he had lifted the canvas cover part way and
  was regarding the unexplainable battle-axe.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But I came past soon afterwards, between then and the
time Belvoir and his party reached the tower—and there was
no Cosgrove staring at a battle-axe then! What does Belvoir’s
evidence imply, if it is evidence? Did the axe leap up and smite
him while he gazed, and was he lying there unnoticed by me
when I returned from the cottage of the sisters Delambre?
And that “friend” of Cosgrove’s, who was to come at a little
after a quarter past nine—did he arrive so soon? Precious little
he could have done to harm the Irishman at the appointed time.
If only Wheeler had kept the tryst in the storm, instead of
forgetting it completely in the horror of the night until
Blenkinson nagged it into his memory again! Was this “friend” the
same whose indeterminate face Doctor Aire had perhaps seen,
perhaps not? To ask these questions is to realize how vain they
are! Yet if we are to know the obscure, impalpable limbo of
truth that lies behind this man’s death, must we not know the
answers?</p>

<p>The click of the door-lock startled us in the midst of
almost lively discussion. Paula Lebetwood and her friend
re-entered the conservatory, and Salt stood on the threshold with
a thin sheet of bluish paper in his hand. The American girl
was paler than before, and, I thought, exercising great
self-restraint. While she took her seat beside me, I could see the
tremors pass along her throat with each breath. But her eyes
were staring at the Superintendent, and my glance followed hers.</p>

<p>Salt said, “This paper, I expect, is Mr. Cosgrove’s Will and
Testament.” He held it up for us to grasp at; it was a single
translucent page, a tiny thing to dictate the disposal of great
riches. “With Miss Lebetwood’s permission—I mean by her
request—I’m goin’ to read it to you.”</p>

<p>“One moment,” darted in his Lordship as Salt was about
to begin without taking breath: “don’t you know that it is
highly irregular to read a copy of a Will until all the
legatees—”</p>

<p>“You’ll see why, sir, in a minute. Besides, this is sure to
be the original of the Will, and all the heirs happen to be
present!”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“There’s not much to it, you might say, sir. And Miss
Lebetwood particularly wants there to be no misunderstanding.”</p>

<p>Forthwith, in that zone of awe, he read the instrument,
dated two months ago. It contained fewer than two hundred
words. I do not know which to admire most, the clear-cut
terseness of it, or the hard cynical sense of its incidental
comments, such as, “my body to be buried as soon as possible
after my death and as near as practicable to the place of my
death, with the least emolument to lawyers, priests, and
undertakers.” And withal, according to those of us who have scanned
the law most thoroughly, the Will is adamant to any who
may attempt to break it.</p>

<p>As for its sense, it devises Cosgrove’s entire fortune to Miss
Lebetwood “for her own absolute use and benefit without
exception, limitation, reservation or condition, forever.”
Cosgrove’s brother, mentioned as having self-denied a share in the
estate, is made sole executor. Rather pathetic, those words:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>“IRELAND DELIVERED is the cross in whose sign I
  would conquer; but should I die, without me I know the good
  work can never go on. Therefore to her who is, or is to be,
  my dearest helpmeet and sharer of these the Lord’s bounties,
  best fit to use them wisely, I bequeath all my worldly goods.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Salt gave us a few breaths to absorb the shock of this
overpowering disclosure. I was almost clean stupefied, but I
confess that a feeling of despondency came over me at that
moment. It was not, of course, that I grudged Paula Lebetwood
the fortune <em>for herself</em>. But I had supposed, in what brief
moments I had thought of it, that Cosgrove’s money would have
gone to fight Cosgrove’s good fight, even though a losing one.
The lines of that fine poem recurred to me:</p>

<blockquote class="verse">

  <p>“They went forth to battle but they always fell:</p>
  <p>Their eyes were set above the sullen shields.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, that had not been this Irishman’s philosophy; the great
cause must wait now for the next great man.</p>

<p>The women had instantly begun to crowd about Miss Lebetwood
with exclamations of surprise and pleasure, a flutter of
congratulation which must have been an ordeal for the
American girl.</p>

<p>Salt extracted from a side pocket an envelope whose flap
he loosened with a pencil. He made the round of the room
so that each of us could see what was inside. “Paper-ash, this
is sure to be. It was all there was in Mr. Cosgrove’s grate. Not
a word legible, but one or two blank bits didn’t get burned,
as you see. . . . Now, there’s no paper like that anywhere
in the house; Mr. Pendleton will go surety for it. It’s different
paper from the ‘Lochinvar’ bit. I was wonderin’ if any of
you ladies and gentlemen had some like it—could explain the
note, perhaps.”</p>

<p>But not even Eve Bartholomew could help the
Superintendent now.</p>

<p>Salt turned to Crofts. “It couldn’t have been in the post,
you say?”</p>

<p>Crofts answered doggedly, “Cosgrove never got any mail.”</p>

<p>“For a man who never got any mail, he had a tidy bit of
mysterious correspondence. Well, I see I shall have to wait a
bit before I find what little secret was here.” He looked at
his large silver watch. “Thank you very much, all. I don’t
think I’ll need to trouble any of you again soon; so I’ll just
take this opportunity to give you a suggestion, and maybe a
bit o’ reassurance. There are a good many folks we haven’t
located that must have somethin’ to do with this case. You
all know about Sir Brooke—Mortimer, I think it is; well, I’m
telegraphin’ for full particulars of him from wherever he
came from, and havin’ a look-out made for him. There are
two men Mr. Bannerlee ran across the night he came that I
want to find, and also it seems that those Frenchwomen, the
Delambres, aren’t on their patch of land. Through one of these
outside channels, we’ll come upon a solution. And that means
simply routine police work. However, if I were you, I’d not go
about separately very far from the House, and just for
precaution’s sake you might lock your doors and windows. No
alarm, you understand—only you’ll feel safer. Doctor Niblett
will hold the inquest as soon as possible. I shall probably be
here a good bit for the next few days, and I trust, with the
kind permission of Mr. Pendleton, that you will not end your
visits until I am certain-sure you can’t assist me.”</p>

<p>“Only too glad, Superintendent to have them all stay until
you’ve cornered the brute,” said Crofts between his teeth. Then,
becoming expansive, he looked about with a satisfied air. “Well,
I’m beginning to think this won’t be a Scotland Yard case
after all. And it’s one of those outsiders surely. Crazy to think
it could be any of us.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a strange voice was in the room. “And I, Mr.
Pendleton, believe in the possible implication of everyone
here, including myself.” Paula Lebetwood said the words,
unlike any speech we had heard from her lips, a terribly
controlled utterance, toneless, as if some insentient thing had
spoken. She stood up. The tremor of her throat was still.</p>

<p>“Of yourself, dearest?” cried Miss Mertoun. “How awful
to say such a thing!”</p>

<p>“Of yourself!” echoed half a dozen voices.</p>

<p>She was looking straight ahead, sightlessly. “Isn’t it too clear
for words? Can’t you understand how <em>I</em> feel?—how I have
felt all these weeks? It rests on me, don’t you see? How can I
ever touch a cent that was his until his killer has paid for his
death? Oh, I’ve felt it ever since he told me—told me he was
going to make his Will—” Her eyes darkened, and the first
tinge of feeling came into her voice: bitterness. “I was a fool.
I should have told him—then.”</p>

<p>Miss Mertoun came over, leaned her cheek against Paula’s,
recalling to me that first scene by the tower on the lawn.
“Paula, <em>dearest</em>.” Gently she pressed the American girl back
into her seat, soothed her with soft little speeches, almost
made her smile.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Bartholomew lifted her head, an expression
of penetrative power on her face, as if she were probing
beyond the realm of sense. She made a quick outreaching gesture
with her hands, withdrew them, clasped them in her lap. She
began to speak once, but checked herself. Then:</p>

<p>“I have the eeriest feeling, but it is strong, so <em>strong</em>!”</p>

<p>“What feeling do you mean?” asked Alberta Pendleton
with bated breath.</p>

<p>Eve Bartholomew’s eyes were shining wide. “That Sir
Brooke is <em>here</em>, <em>now</em>, among us!”</p>

<p>She stirred us. We pitied her then, in silence. Whatever
he had been to her, or she to him—</p>

<p>She turned to the window close beside her. “This flood
may end to-morrow, but it’s the act of Providence all the
same!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Mrs. Bartholomew,” protested Belvoir’s soft
voice. “It’s deuced inconvenient; no two ways about that.
We may have to take spades and bury our poor friend here on
the spot if it keeps up.”</p>

<p>“That was his wish, wasn’t it?” she retorted. “I say this
sundering flood has been our one blessing. How shall the
guilty escape now, if he is not one of us? And if he <em>is</em> one
of us—” Her eyes beneath that lustrous black hair shone like
gems in a mine. “If he <em>is</em>, he will betray himself before the
flood goes down!”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” exclaimed Lord Ludlow. “Madam, I applaud you.
You have feeling, and I respect you for it.”</p>

<p>Miss Lebetwood raised her voice to the man across the room.
“That sounds like an indictment of me, sir.”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>The American went on. “I suppose I seem to have no grief,
no feeling. I am passionless; oh, yes! I tell you I am devoted
to only one thing, the finding of the murderer. My task
commences to-day, this hour, now. I see by the look on all your
faces, and one of them still may be a murderer’s face, that you
are shocked. No, I have sorrow; I am not hard-hearted, save
for a purpose. I have sorrow—you will never know how
much—but I must get it behind me.”</p>

<p>The easy tones of Superintendent Salt intervened. “Miss,
I wouldn’t feel so. Everyone is heartily takin’ your part. Why
you should think otherwise I don’t know. And have no doubt
of one thing: we shall get at the heart of this mystery soon.”</p>

<p>“We must,” said Eve Bartholomew. “The innocent suffer
as well as the guilty.”</p>

<p>“I am now going to make a careful inspection of the House,”
said Salt. “I got the lay of the land before turnin’ in last
night, but now, ladies and gentlemen, I shall take the liberty
of lookin’ through your rooms. Mr. Pendleton, I particularly
want to see those store-places Mr. Cosgrove evidently had a
fancy for, and the cellars. Plenty of cellars, of course?”</p>

<p>“Plenty. And a sub-cellar no one’s been in since before we
bought the property.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea what’s down there?”</p>

<p>“How should I know? Nothing, I suppose. And anyhow,
the trap-covers are locked with padlocks and sealed with an
inch of dust.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” said Salt good-naturedly, “I don’t think I’ll
make you sweep ’em off and unlock ’em. Only take me where
they are.”</p>

<p>Again while he and Pendleton made their way from the
conservatory, I was assailed with doubt concerning the confident
Salt. Was he to fumble the case after all? For it seemed
to me in trying to resolve an enigma so baffling, no opening
ought to be ignored. And the Superintendent was, to say the
least, eclectic, when he chose not to enter the sub-cellars.</p>

<p>A hand was laid on my shoulder. I looked up, and was held
by those eyes with their unsearchable gleam, Maryvale’s.</p>

<p>“How will they ever solve this riddle and set this wrong
aright, if they forget the spanning and roofing of the waters,
and the deathless arm?”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you, Mr. Maryvale.”</p>

<p>“What were Sir Pharamond’s words? ‘Let traitors beware!’
Mr. Bannerlee, remember, sir, that they never found
the arm of Sir Pharamond—and his tomb in old Aidenn
Church attests it.”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Gilbert has a theory all his own,” laughed Belvoir
in a friendly manner. “It has absolute novelty to recommend
it, and artistic value. It’s the artistic side that appeals to you,
isn’t it, Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“Truth appeals to me as well.”</p>

<p>“Well, really—truth!”</p>

<p>“What is your theory, Mr. Maryvale?” I asked with an attempt
to disregard the twinges of apprehension that I felt in
his presence.</p>

<p>“I have no theory: I have the key.”</p>

<p>“Gilbert means that the corporeal, material, substantial
right arm of Sir Pharamond Kay, builder of the castle which
now is Highglen House, has risen from its cerements and
laid a certain party low. Isn’t that about it, Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“It is all you need to know.”</p>

<p>“But what’s that about the proof being in Old Aidenn
Church?”</p>

<p>Belvoir gave a sly chuckle. “Go there some afternoon and
have a look for yourself, Mr. Bannerlee. Old Aidenn is only
three miles beyond New Aidenn, and both of ’em happen to
be as old as Doomsday.”</p>

<p>“It’s as sound, anyhow, as Crofts’ idea that a murderer
couldn’t escape from Aidenn Vale,” remarked Aire.</p>

<p>For my part, I looked first at Maryvale’s stooped retreating
bulk, and then at the other two men, who solemnly looked at
me. We did not speak, but the same thought must have been
in all of us. The servants might understandably be shy of
strange forms in the dark, but what was to become of <em>us</em>,
if we began gravely to discuss wee grey-bearded men with
voices like honey, or pixies perched on toadstools?</p>

<p>Young Bob Cullen had strayed to the window, was watching
the raindrops, now meandering slowly, now darting down
the pane.</p>

<p>“Talk about Noah’s Flood,” he growled.</p>

<p>“Forty days he had of it,” mused Lib Dale. “If this keeps
up forty minutes more, I’ll be dotty. Oh, look!”</p>

<p>The whole conservatory thrilled with light. A golden-green
path lay shimmering across the lawn. It had ceased to rain.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch13">

<h2>XIII. <br> The Weapon</h2>

<p>Suddenly, and very softly, Superintendent Salt
was among us once more. I knew of his presence only when I
heard him speak.</p>

<p>“My Lord, one more question, if you please. The man—Soames
I believe his name is—who has just conducted me to
the cellars says you gave him a letter to post last evening.”</p>

<p>“I did—confound him! I handed it to him and expressed
a wish that if the storm should cease as suddenly as it
commenced, it might reach New Aidenn in time to go out in this
morning’s post. Of course, when the downpour showed no sign
of abating, I had it back.”</p>

<p>“I presumed so, my Lord. In that case, I shall have to see
the letter, with your permission.”</p>

<p>“And that you certainly shall not!”</p>

<p>Salt was like the everlasting hills. “Only the envelope, my
Lord. The superscription is all I need to see.”</p>

<p>After a long ten-seconds’ hesitation Lord Herbert drew a
letter from his breast-pocket and held it close to the
Superintendent’s face. Salt peered.</p>

<p>“Hm. Is that it? Seems to be. Stamp uncancelled. To the
Bangor and Newcastle Corporation, eh? 12 Gate Street,
London, E. C. Very innocent, I’m sure, my Lord. Thank you.”</p>

<p>I saw the quick purple flash into the Baron’s face when
Salt read aloud the words intended only for his eye. “I
consider this an impertinence, sir.”</p>

<p>“To be called things is all in my day’s work, my Lord,”
responded Salt, and turning to Pendleton, he said, “You ought
to open a little Post Office here.”</p>

<p>“What on earth for?”</p>

<p>“For surreptitious mail.”</p>

<p>“Bangor and Newcastle Corporation,” I could not help
repeating puzzledly, half-aloud, I fear. “What on earth
connection can there be between little Bangor with its agriculture
and Druid Circle, and the coal and battleships of
Newcastle-on-Tyne?”</p>

<p>Ludlow said nothing, but I observed in his eye and in the
hook of his bloodless lip a sublime contempt for my ignorance.</p>

<p>But at that moment everyone save me was looking toward
the door leading to the Hall of the Moth, which had opened
sufficiently to admit first the head and then the rest of
Blenkinson. Again the look of transcendence appeared natural, even
casual on his person. Spiritual transcendence, that is, for
bodily he was in great bedragglement, as if he had wallowed
in the rain just before it ended.</p>

<p>“Mr. Salt, I beg to report that the weapon ’as been found.
I ’ave left it where I and Finlay discovered it, almost—”</p>

<p>I think the feeling of elation that visited me was shared
by nearly everyone in the conservatory. I saw faces
brightening. But Salt’s did not.</p>

<p>The Superintendent gave one leap toward Blenkinson,
cutting him dead off in the midst of his glory.</p>

<p>“Mr. Blenkinson, your admirable researches—invaluable
assistance—indispensable services—fill me with alarm. Please be
more discreet. Inform me in private of your discoveries, and
let <em>me</em> be the judge whether they are to be shared by these
ladies and gentlemen. For, mind you, <em>technically</em>, every person
here is under suspicion—and that goes for you, too, Mr.
Blenkinson. You may, or may not, be revealin’ something valuable
to the murderer himself.”</p>

<p>Under this withering sardonic fire the smug efficiency of
the butler had fallen ingloriously. “I’m—‘gulp’—very sorry,
sir, but—‘gulp’—the fact is, I was so helated—‘gulp’—that
I—”</p>

<p>“Quite,” agreed Salt; “quite. And now, Mr. Blenkinson,
if you please, lead the way to this weapon, whatever it is.” He
thrust the butler before him through the door into the Hall,
and looked back upon the threshold. “Kindly do not let your
curiosity to see Mr. Blenkinson’s find tempt you to follow us,
any of you. Thank you.” The door closed.</p>

<p>The weapon found! Tongues were wagging anew. I thought
of the difference between Salt’s previous assurance to us that
the solution was to be sought among the many missing
persons, and his recent proclamation that no one in the House
was exempt as a possible murderer. Then in the midst of the
babble came a still voice close behind me. I turned; Doctor Aire
was leaning over the piano, his abbreviated form easily
sheltering underneath the lifted cover.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bannerlee, how about a stroll up the Vale, now it
promises fair weather? Mr. Salt has admonished us to go in
pairs.”</p>

<p>“Up the Vale—now? You must be emulating Noah himself,
Doctor! The waters haven’t yet descended from Ararat.”</p>

<p>“I want to get rid of this cursed miasma of flowers. It’s
like some noxious emanation. My head aches with odours.”</p>

<p>“But surely it’s out of the question. Why, after this
downpour, the Vale’s certain to be swampland all the way up to
Water-break-its-neck.”</p>

<p>The yellowy doctor shook his head, smiling. “Strange, but
you’re wrong. You should really dig into the lore of this
region, Mr. Bannerlee. The Welsh name of our locality, I
have read, is Maesyfed.”</p>

<p>“Oh? Meaning?”</p>

<p>“The absorbent field, probably. For the thirsty soil does
wonders after rain; in summer even Aidenn Water sinks
underground for long distances and leaves its channel dry.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m in favour of getting out of here if it can be
done.”</p>

<p>“It can; I know from previous visits. We’ll give the sun and
soil a couple of hours to restore dry footing.”</p>

<p>“Well enough. I’ll meet you in the library.”</p>

<p>Salt re-entered just then and took Aire away with a few
whispered words. I wandered into the dinner-room where
stragglers were sitting at belated luncheon, for since yesterday’s
disaster the schedule of meals seems to have fallen into
anarchy. I did not stay long at the board, however; perhaps
the fumes of the conservatory had stopped the pangs of
appetite. I excused myself and crossed to the armoury, intending
first to glance over the array of the library shelves in the hope
of discovering something of interest, then to go to my room
and set down some of the multitudinous details of last night
and to-day.</p>

<p>But I never got as far as the library. I heard a strenuous
young voice through its door ajar:</p>

<p>“Ah, g’wan. You make me laugh—<em>you</em>. When they put a
lily in your hand, you’ll deserve the Good Boy’s Epitaph.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Bob suspiciously.</p>

<p>“ ‘He loved his grandmother.’ ”</p>

<p>“You think you’re funny, don’t you? Well, I wasn’t crazy
about this Cosgrove. I would have been ready to do him in.
He was no good for Paula, even if he did have all that coin.
He was a fast worker, that’s what he was. I guess you ought
to know. He was a dirty bum.”</p>

<p>“ ‘Swine’ is what you say in this country.”</p>

<p>“I said I’d have polished him off, and I meant it. Wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Hush up, Bobby. Keep that stuff under your hat. You don’t
want somebody to overhear you talking crazy, do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>Lib lowered her voice and spoke rapidly. “Yes, I would,
for a brick like Paula. My God, what a man Cosgrove was!
And she fell for him!” Then, “Change the subject, change
the subject! To hear you talk like that would give an alligator
nervous prostration. Suppose a few of those detectives were
in the armoury.”</p>

<p>There was a spell of silence, sharply broken by Lib. “Leggo
my hand! What do you think this is, a golf links?”</p>

<p>“You tol’ me to change the subject,” said Bob with deep
grievance.</p>

<p>“Don’t be sil. Say, I think there <em>is</em> somebody in there. Look
quick.”</p>

<p>But I had fled into the corridor and, laughing heartily
within, was half-way up the stairs.</p>

<p>In my room I immersed myself in that task of writing which
has become almost my principal interest. I quite lost track
of time while I wrote of Salt’s arrival last evening and the
rest of it. With a start I recalled Aire, looked at my watch,
and leaped down the stairs. It was nearly four.</p>

<p>The short, spindly-legged man was waiting, and with a
touch of annoyance I saw that Maryvale was consulting some
book in a corner of the library, a book which he put down
upon my arrival as if he expected to accompany us.</p>

<p>“Gilbert has consented to come along.”</p>

<p>“Oh? Glad.”</p>

<p>The sky was unblemished with cloud when we set out for
that supposedly uneventful walk in the bracing hill-air, but
the sun had sloped nearly to the high horizon of the ridge,
and the light already had in it a subtle infiltration of yellow.
Some jewels still glittered on the lawn, but the turf was
surprisingly firm and pleasant to the tread.</p>

<p>We struck under the shade of the cypresses; through the
systematic “wilderness” of planted trees we strode, toward the
pretentious bridge, past the mouldering eighteenth-century
summer-house, a thing quite dismantled and defeated and gutted
out. Once I had fancied it as a possible hiding-place for
mysterious visitants, but now I rejected it utterly. The old smooth
lawns there were now ragged stretches of rough grass, still
heavy with the rain where they lay beneath any trees, and
sluggish lake-like ponds were the remains of once sparkling
basins.</p>

<p>Aire paused where a grey fallen statue and its pedestal lay
beside one of these sad meres, a place where the trees had
hunched their shoulders together to make an extra twilight
shade.</p>

<p>“About here, they say, a former occupant of the mansion,
the one who built that summer-house, was found.”</p>

<p>“How found?”</p>

<p>“Dead, Mr. Bannerlee, with his head neatly shorn away
from the rest of him. That was nearly two hundred years ago.”
He grunted. “The chap <em>ought</em> to have been killed for putting
up that thing.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Who had done it?”</p>

<p>“I wish I could tell you. He was never discovered. I don’t
think the victim was a very popular gentleman; so there may
have been connivance in keeping the secret locked away. A
baffling affair it must have been for the Salts of that day. The
time-and-space problem was mystifying then as now it is in
Cosgrove’s death.”</p>

<p>I looked curiously at the little man with the broad shoulders.
“Doctor, you certainly hit upon the queerest tales. Where could
you have found that recorded?”</p>

<p>“On a special pasted-in leaf of an old family Bible. Quite a
fascinating library Crofts owns without comprehending it.”</p>

<p>“This is accursed ground,” said Maryvale. “It reeks with
lawless bloodshed.”</p>

<p>We left the park with its sickly poetry and bore to the right
by a field-path toward the prosaic potato-patch of the sisters
Delambre, where the scarecrow bore almost too great a likeness
to Baron Ludlow in his tweeds to be laid to coincidence.
It was here that the brook later spanned by the absurd bridge
came down from the indentation of the hill. We followed the
narrow channel, where the rain-swollen stream now leaped
against its banks, to where the deserted cottage stood in an
oak-clump. The morsel of a stone-roofed house gave only a shy
peep from its covert; it was like a doll’s house, dwarfed by
overshadowing branches.</p>

<p>“Do you think it possible that these women were concerned
either last night or the night before? What were they like?”</p>

<p>“Cranky Frenchwomen. I’ve seen them on previous visits,”
answered Aire. “They always gave me the impression of being
a couple of—well, I might say unfrocked nuns, if you
understand.”</p>

<p>“Sounds rather ambiguous, Doctor,” I remarked.</p>

<p>I was suddenly put in mind of a tale I had heard in another
spot of demon-haunted Wales, and I told it with some gusto.
There two sisters had lived together and managed a small farm
with the aid of one man. They were unfamiliar people and the
country-folk were turned askance to them. The pair would
vanish at a particular time of day, and their hats would be
hanging in their bedrooms upon the looking-glass. One afternoon
the farmhand hid under their bed to find out their secret.
He saw them take off their caps and hang them on the glass,
whereupon they themselves immediately turned to cats, and ran
to the dairy and began lapping the cream.</p>

<p>A somewhat dubious look upon Aire’s face as he gazed at
Maryvale during my recital was, I fear, lost on me, for it
gave me a thrilling pleasure to apply this tale to the sisters
Delambre, particularly since in that grimalkin of appalling
voice they had a fit companion for many an impious Sabbath.</p>

<p>“And by the way,” I concluded, “the beast spared us its
caterwauling last night.”</p>

<p>“Last night, but not to-night,” said Maryvale. “It will be
hungrier than ever to-night. We shall hear it, unless—”</p>

<p>“Unless what?”</p>

<p>“We shall see,” he parried.</p>

<p>“It’s a vicious beast, if ever there was one,” said Aire,
looking in one of the cottage windows. “It’s twice the size you’d
believe it could attain. There’s never been any other cat in the
Vale whose nine lives were worth sixpence when this animal
discovered its presence.”</p>

<p>“And the birds,” added Maryvale. “The nightingales that
once loved this valley so—scarcely one is left.”</p>

<p>Returning toward Aidenn Water at a point somewhat
further north, we heard from beyond a gnarl of blackberry
bushes the sound of footsteps and voices which proved to be
those of Salt, wearing rubber boots, and of Hughes the keeper.
They were making their way up the stream by the principal
path, and I noticed that Hughes bore an axe of considerable
heft.</p>

<p>Salt greeted us while we fell into step. “Sensible to get out
of doors.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not here for your health, I fancy,” said Aire.</p>

<p>“I am not. Mr. Hughes here and I are going to devote the
last hour of daylight to satisfyin’ ourselves about traces of the
assassin on the other side of the Vale. We’ve scoured north,
south, east, and west on this side of the stream, and never
a footprint of him or anybody else. Mr. Pendleton seemed
a bit anxious we shouldn’t overlook the chance, and it is a
chance.”</p>

<p>“What is that axe for?” suddenly demanded Maryvale.</p>

<p>“To chop down a tree, sir,” answered Hughes. “I know
where I can make one fall across the Water. It’s the only way
to get over.”</p>

<p>“I thought as much,” I said. “What, just, is the state of
things down at the bridge?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a trace of it left, sir,” Salt informed me.
“Sometime last night the stone ends were undermined by the current.
There are men on the other side, though, riggin’ up a
makeshift, and to-morrow, maybe, if the stream goes down
reasonably, we can get out of here, and get Mr. Cosgrove’s body
out, too.”</p>

<p>Hughes pointed to the north, where the zigzag path down
the mountain had been obliterated by the landslip. “Men from
Penybont beyond the Forest are coming from the other side to
clear that up to-morrow, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, someone must have been moving heaven and earth!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; Mr. Pendleton was quite busy on the ’phone this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“That telephone is not the least of our miracles,” I observed.
“I should have expected the line to be smashed to smithereens
by the storm.”</p>

<p>“Our wires run underground, sir,” said the keeper.</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, all the way to New Aidenn. There was too much
trouble with it the other way; so Mr. Pendleton had it changed.
Now nothing ever interferes with it.”</p>

<p>I remembered something. “To bring into this discussion
an element sadly wanting—”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Disclosures. Tell me, Superintendent, does the pall of
official secrecy still cover the weapon discovered by the astute
Blenkinson?”</p>

<p>“Not much use trying to keep anything secret hereabout,”
said Salt with a smile, which made me wonder what recent
discoveries actually reposed undivulged beneath that sodden hat
and those iron-grey curly locks. “The lid is off that little
matter.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> the weapon? What had Blenkinson found?”</p>

<p>“A piece of angular slate, well shaped for holdin’, provided
with an almost sharp edge. Queer, isn’t it? Here’s a chap—I
mean the guilty party—helped himself to what he wanted
out of the armoury the night before; now, when he’s in a
killin’ mood, he fetches along a stone. Plenty of rock like it in
the Vale, of course. Seems likely, though, that it was picked
up from that gimcrack rockery old Finlay wants to get rid
of—just opposite the tower where Cosgrove was found.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure it’s the instrument?” I asked.</p>

<p>Salt looked at Aire, who said, “The Superintendent called
in Doctor Niblett and me for our opinions on that point. The
Coroner and I agree that in the hands of a vigorous person,
who must have approached Cosgrove secretly from behind, the
stone might well have done the damage.”</p>

<p>“But where was it lying?” I asked, with incredulity
sounding in my tone. “How could we have missed it?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t lyin’ anywhere,” answered Salt. “That’s a feature
about it. It was embedded, sir, almost buried among the flowers
outside the central windows of the Hall. If the rain hadn’t
played hob with the beds, and the man Finlay with Mr. Blenkinson
hadn’t been assessin’ the damage, it might have remained
there unnoticed for a tidy while.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, though, that’s a far-fetched hiding-place.”</p>

<p>Salt raised his brows. “Is it? I think it was a clever one,
sir. One second he strikes the blow, the next he hurls the
weapon straight down into the loam. Inside half a minute
he may be anywhere, and nothin’ to connect him with
the crime. Just a little more energy, and the earth would
have fallen in about the edges and covered the stone
completely. But as it was it must have taken strength, gigantic
strength.”</p>

<p>“It must have taken superhuman strength, Mr. Salt. Why,
there had been rain, but it blew a bit easterly then, and those
beds couldn’t have got much of it. It was nothing like last
night’s inundation. The ground must have been hard.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, the ground was exceedingly soft. Remember
what it said in Mr. Blenkinson’s document, sir. Finlay
had been waterin’ those very beds, and waterin’ ’em plenty after
four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Were there any marks on this stone?” asked Maryvale.
“Any signs such as I understand often guide the police in their
search?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, none. And—”</p>

<p>“I thought so.”</p>

<p>Ignoring this somewhat cryptic remark, Salt explained:
“Unpolished stone isn’t a good medium for takin’ impressions.
I’ll stake my little finger, though, it was the stone that finished
Mr. Cosgrove.”</p>

<p>“Here we turn off, sir,” advised Hughes.</p>

<p>We had been in sight of Aidenn Water much of the time,
its cheerful flow increased to boiling spate. Through a partly
cleared copse of larch, we could see it now, laughing with white
teeth and greedy gurgle along a sort of rapids. The particular
tree Hughes intended to chop was visible, already leaning
half across the flood.</p>

<p>Somewhat to my discomfiture, Aire announced that he intended
to accompany the pair across the stream. “Don’t mind,
do you, Bannerlee? I want to be in at the death of Pendleton’s
theory. Or will you two come along with us? Any objection,
Superintendent?”</p>

<p>“More the merrier,” said Salt.</p>

<p>But I cared nothing for the death of any theory compared
with my eagerness to get farther north and see the great ruin
beneath the hills again. Maryvale had no love for the thought
of crossing above the churlish Water on a tree-trunk, and
said so. We left the three proceeding to the bank of the stream,
but I confess it was with a pang of premonition that I paced
beside the man of business and heard the sound of the lusty
axe grow fainter and fainter.</p>

<h2>XIV. <br> The Fiendish Cat of the Sisters Delambre</h2>

<p>For half an hour we walked on almost in silence,
making the tritest remarks about our surroundings, particularly
those peaks which shut in the valley ahead of us, from Great
Rhos on the left across Black Mixen to Mynydd Tarw on our
right. We now saw only a broken secant of the sun, and most of
our light was reflected from the golden tops of the hills.
Maryvale for some reason maintained an unusually sharp look-out,
glancing restlessly every way among the glades.</p>

<p>Almost before I was aware, we had reached the outer of
those dejected and scattered walls for so many centuries lying
the prey of the elements and the spoil of house-builders and
church-builders from down the Vale and beyond.</p>

<p>Some of these still remained high enough to show the
embrasures where the upper windows had been, tall, slender
apertures, one of them far on the other side even now perfect
in the stonework of transom and mullions and semi-rounded
arch. It was indeed the ruin of a knightly house, once spacious
and splendid. The fallen walls seemed to have been struck or
hurled outward by some terrific force or inward convulsion, as
if behemoth had stirred and heaved himself from beneath the
floor.</p>

<p>Flanking the walls to the left, where I had come past two
nights ago and encountered the menagerie-keeper, I peered
inside, over a chin-high portion, and gave an exclamation of
surprise. The thick walls had indeed been hurled down from
within. The vast flat slabs of the floor, what few of them
remained, were tossed in disorder, and the earth on which they
lay was piled in fantastic heaps alongside deep, irregular
trenches—all grass-grown now, of course. A few bushes and
one enormous beech tree found livelihood inside the wall.</p>

<p>For a couple of minutes Maryvale had been standing quiet
behind me, peering this way and that in the twilight, as if he
looked for some particular object.</p>

<p>“This gutted carcass makes me fancy things,” I laughed.
“Come, Maryvale, sweep the spider-webs out of my mind by
flourishing vigorously the broom of truth. In other words,
relate to me something about this place, and pity on your life if
it’s the old story of ‘deflor’d by Glindur.’ ”</p>

<p>“Why, haven’t you heard?”</p>

<p>“If I did it went in one ear and out the other. Say on.”</p>

<p>I braced my hands on the broken top of the wall and leaped
up, making my seat there. Maryvale joined me with very little
effort, and we sat there kicking our heels schoolboy-like.</p>

<p>Again I saw him look about very intently, under the beeches,
through the gaps between the stones, across the scrub growth
between us and Aidenn Water a quarter of a mile distant.</p>

<p>“What are you looking for, Maryvale?”</p>

<p>“Sathanas.”</p>

<p>“This place is too thinly populated, my friend. Come, what
of this ancient hold? Bring on your heroes and cravens, your
demigods and dastards.”</p>

<p>“Gwrn darw—the pile of contention,” muttered Maryvale,
and he launched on the story.</p>

<p>I had expected another farrago of myth and tradition, perhaps
larded with the same episodes that Hughes had spellbound
us with in the dinner-room yesterday morning. Instead it was
a fairly plausible story from some wholly different source, this
account of the first historical building in Aidenn Vale. I
enjoyed listening to the narrative; Maryvale enjoyed telling it.
Gusto was the keynote of his voice, with its rapid utterance and
changes of inflection. He made drama of it, and a valiant man
of Sir Pharamond.</p>

<p>“Why, Maryvale, where did you learn all this?”</p>

<p>“This is history,” he affirmed solemnly.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was beginning to peer about again, turning
more than once in his speech to stare beneath the branches of
the trees. That feeling of repugnance to Maryvale which I
had before experienced returned hazily, and of a sudden I
realized how lonely this place was, how close to us the hills
were, and how dark and steep. I might instantly have urged
our return had not my own roving glance caught a black
object protruding from a bush inside the wall.</p>

<p>I broke in. “Look! Here’s evidence the world’s a
madhouse!”</p>

<p>Down inside the wall I slipped, crossed to the bush, and
triumphantly held high the black umbrella.</p>

<p>“He was real, Maryvale! He was no nightmare!”</p>

<p>While I unfastened the loop and opened the umbrella,
Maryvale dropped from his seat and came beside me. He
asked me what this was, where it came from, and whom I had
met here, all in a breath.</p>

<p>“This is a clue, man!” I exclaimed. “Perhaps it has some
manufacturer’s mark—what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>I could no more have released my arm from Maryvale’s
grip than from the strongest vise. But in a moment his hand
relaxed, and then I caught sight of what he was looking at so
hard.</p>

<p>On the northern wall, twice the height of that whereupon
we had been sitting, crept something darker than the hills
against which its form was obscure. Softly, swiftly, the form
slunk along the stones, then gave a leap to the arched summit
of that one perfect window and stood still, its head lifted, its
form now stark against the sky—the form of an enormous cat,
lean and lithe and tigerish.</p>

<p>Maryvale was breathing loudly. I gave him a swift look;
his face was working, and with his eyes set on the cat of the
sisters Delambre, he drew from a hip pocket the last thing on
earth I should have imagined him to carry, a large revolver,
one of the sort called in America, I believe, a six-shooter.</p>

<p>But the hideous expression of his face was more alarming
still.</p>

<p>Here was a combination of circumstances I did not envisage
hopefully: the lonely spot, the great cat, the man apparently
unbalanced by the sight of the beast, and the revolver.
I had only the umbrella.</p>

<p>Not a little afraid, I sought safety in valour. I reached out
my hand.</p>

<p>“May I see that, Mr. Maryvale?”</p>

<p>He let me have the weapon without demur, and while I
examined the deadly thing, I saw out of the corner of my eye
that his attention was still riveted on the shape of the cat. I
hesitated to break into that almost hypnotic absorption.</p>

<p>Perhaps a minute passed. I had put down the umbrella.</p>

<p>Then from the gloaming woods that fringed the mountain
foot welled a sound like a bright bubble bursting into a
hundred bubbles, a sound like the spray of a sweet fountain—the
song of a nightingale from the deep solitudes of Black Mixen.</p>

<p>“The nightingale of Water-break-its-neck,” I thought, for
I had heard someone speak of this lonely music-maker.</p>

<p>The form of the cat stiffened; gradually it sank to a crouching
posture, as if its prey were near at hand. Then tail and
head went up, and its jaws were sharp against the sky, and the
valley bristled with its starved and destructive yowl.</p>

<p>Maryvale was a man transformed from trance to action.
Spasmodically he felt his pocket for the pistol, then recollected
me. His voice was jumbled with the cry of the beast.</p>

<p>“Give me that gun.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be better—”</p>

<p>His utterance was quickly controlled to a whisper. “Give me
that gun. I am going to perform a humane act. I came here
for this.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Maryvale—”</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand?” he burst out. “I will free the soul
of a ghoul from its tenement!” He grabbed the pistol from
my hand.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake—!”</p>

<p>“I am the best shot in the Midlands with one of these.” He
raised the weapon with a marksman’s care and confidence.</p>

<p>The animal, surprised by our voices, had reared its head in
our direction, and now, instead of making off, scrambled
down from the window arch and came loping toward us,
growling, as if it actually contemplated an attack. Its fur on
end swelled it to twice its size. Maryvale shifted his aim
quickly, and the clustering hills resounded with the echo of his
shot.</p>

<p>But the cat, unhurt, sprang toward us spitting and snarling,
with eyes that flashed. I realized when I saw those intensely
flaming eyes that green, not red, must be the colour of
hell-fire.</p>

<p>Again the revolver blazed, with no effect save to cause the
beast to give a high leap toward Maryvale, full length upright,
all fours spread wide and clawing, mouth hissing. Maryvale
shot point-blank in the face of the animal, and the beast was
enveloped in a fiery cloud, but it dropped to earth on all fours,
fled unscathed past us, and disappeared beneath a bush.</p>

<p>Maryvale lifted his hands to the dark and empty sky. “Too
strong—too strong—the infernal magic of this place.”</p>

<p>I took a step toward the man, grasped the weapon, tugged to
get it from him, cried, “What did you expect? You’ve loaded
this pistol with blank cartridges.”</p>

<p>“Blanks?” he shouted. “Never a bit.”</p>

<p>Twenty feet away a straggling thin branch of a rowan tree
came over the western wall and was ebony against the sky,
having at the end some finger-clumps of leaves. Maryvale took
quick aim, eyes protruding grotesquely, and fired; the branch
trembled and one of the leaf stems fell away. Twice again the
pistol rang out; the branch itself suddenly hung down, all but
severed by the final bullet.</p>

<p>Maryvale laughed wildly with tempestuous eyes. “I should
have known it was impossible. You cannot kill the soul of
Parson Lolly with lead.”</p>

<p>He threw away the weapon, went lunging along the wall.
I followed, took him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Maryvale—”</p>

<p>But he thrust me off, violently, and began to run. I fell with
my knee against a stone, and when I arose my chagrin was
great, for apart from the pain my leg had gone almost dead,
and I could scarcely hobble. Maryvale had found a gap between
the stones, leaped through, and charged down the Vale. When
I had managed to drag myself out from the enclosure, he was
beyond sight and hearing. I shouted his name many times; no
answer came back.</p>

<p>I knew that lamed as I was I must get down the Vale as
soon as possible, for there was no telling what the man might
do in this demented state. He might even have another gun.</p>

<p>The cat the incarnation of Parson Lolly! Then the realization
leaped on me. What would they say, those in the House,
when they were told that none of the three bullets had done
the beast any harm!</p>

<p>So stunned I was by this lightning-stroke that without
knowing what I did or being aware of my injured knee, I walked
on with my brain in a storm of confusion. When, some time
later, I was rid of the shock, but still wondering, I had gone
half a mile and my knee was almost painless.</p>

<p>I commenced to run.</p>

<p>Ten minutes late I encountered Doctor Aire, who fell in
beside me while I gasped what had happened.</p>

<p>“I was a fool,” he panted. “Fool to leave him alone with
you. He was excited—upset—I saw—that when you were
telling—that story down by the cottage. You’ll have to—go on
alone. I can’t—keep up.”</p>

<p>He dropped behind, and the last thing I heard him say was,
“I couldn’t foresee—a miracle.”</p>

<p>Talking winded me. I was spent when I reached the
summer-house, and could scarcely walk to the mansion.</p>

<p>Alone in the Hall of the Moth I found Mrs. Belvoir
sitting, rather pointlessly, it seemed.</p>

<p>“Maryvale—here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Bannerlee.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Upstairs. They all followed him when he came in. He is
in his room.”</p>

<p>“Was he violent? Why did they go after him?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly violent, no. But I don’t think it’s worth
while following him any more.”</p>

<p>I checked my foot on the threshold. “What do you mean,
Mrs. Belvoir?”</p>

<p>“A personality balanced on a knife-edge is never safe. Poor
Gilbert was too rash when he tempted the Influences in this
valley. His mind is gone, for certain.”</p>

<p>“Influences?”</p>

<p>“Of course there are Influences. I can feel them myself.
Gilbert is only the first to give in.”</p>

<p>I left this placid lady and made what speed I could up the
stairs. In the passage outside Maryvale’s room on the second
floor, the Coroner and the rest of the men were standing.</p>

<p>“Is he in there?”</p>

<p>“He is,” answered Crofts.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go in to him?”</p>

<p>“Because—well, because—”</p>

<p>“Because we all want to stay healthy,” said Bob Cullen.</p>

<p>I learned what had happened. People in the Hall had seen
Maryvale stagger across the lawn, in their alarm had heard
him enter the armoury and disturb the weapons there. When
some of the men looked into the room, Maryvale had departed,
and a sword was missing. They heard him clamber up the
stairs. Consulting in perplexity for a few moments, they
decided to follow. The curious thing about this part of the
affair is that in those doubtful moments Maryvale had not at
once entered his room at the head of the second flight of stairs,
but for some reason had hastened along the passage on that
upper floor. For while the pursuers were on the second flight,
Maryvale came rushing back, invisible (because of the curve in
the staircase), and secured himself in his chamber. Knocking
and calling evoked no response, save once. Then Maryvale
flung wide the door, in his hand the drawn sword—a thin
two-edged one like a Toledo blade.</p>

<p>“I’ll kill anyone who comes in here,” he said. “Leave me to
do my work.”</p>

<p>“Which,” remarked Ludlow, when Crofts had finished this
account, “I for one am going to accede to, as a reasonable
request.”</p>

<p>We agreed it was best to take turns standing guard. Belvoir,
on account of his being particularly a friend of Maryvale’s,
offered to be the first on duty. We left him there, smoking his
pipe, leaning against the doorpost, his ear to the door.</p>

<p>What “work” could Maryvale be doing?</p>

<p>Poor Crofts, a host with a dead man and a madman in his
house! I passed him on the bottom step, gnawing a knuckle,
apparently making quite a meal.</p>

<p>“Bad luck, old man.”</p>

<p>He regarded me listlessly. “I had a ’phone call this
afternoon from the Post Office. Harry Heatheringham has wired
for full particulars.”</p>

<p>“Ye Gods! Who is Harry Heatheringham?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I supposed you knew. One of the really high-powered
detectives. Happens to be a friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“Scotland Yard?”</p>

<p>“No, he prefers the country air. He’s a Worcester man. I
wonder what Salt would say.”</p>

<p>“Ask him; he can’t arrest you for it. By the way, how does
the great man from Worcester happen to be so prompt in
sniffing out this case?”</p>

<p>Crofts became nervous, as he always does when he has
something to conceal. “He—he—we’re, er, in what you might
call communication. Dash it all, I wish the fellow would keep
his promises!”</p>

<p>Salt came in, just before dinner, not a merry meal. He
heartily approved Harry Heatheringham.</p>

<p>“Do you know, sir, I wouldn’t be sorry to see him on the
ground.”</p>

<p>“I’m damned if I know why he isn’t!” remarked Crofts,
and fled to the telephone, to dictate a lengthy wire.</p>

<p>It transpired that the Superintendent and his aides had found
not the slightest trace of recent human presence across Aidenn
Water. They did not even find a new puzzle; they found
nothing.</p>

<p>But after dinner Salt made a more fruitful inspection
of the rooms on the second floor, except Maryvale’s. He
had been curious to discover why the demented man had
gone down the passage before shutting himself in. He found
why.</p>

<p>“There was a box of paints and a palette and easel, and
some brushes, in the store-room next to you, Mr. Bannerlee.
Mr. Maryvale must have known about ’em, of course.”</p>

<p>“Some canvases on stretchers, too, weren’t there?” added
Crofts. “All here before my time. Seems to me I’ve heard
old Watts used to dabble in paints.”</p>

<p>“They’re all missin’ now, sir,” said Salt. “That’s what he
was after.”</p>

<p>“Paints!” exclaimed Belvoir. “Yes, that explains it, indeed.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“Gilbert Maryvale has been a very unhappy man,” said
Belvoir slowly. “He has been chained to a big business that
would have gone to pieces without him. He has made lots of
money, but always wanted to be a painter. You see, Mr.
Superintendent, he had an exquisitely sensitive spirit, for all his
dealing in bills and notes.”</p>

<p>“I’m tryin’ to see,” said Salt.</p>

<p>“Well, he will never look in the flabby faces of a Board of
Directors again. He has begun to paint.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Is all the heart-crushing suspense in the world packed into
this little Vale? Beyond the hills, I know, men and women are
peacefully sleeping, and farther beyond, in the Glamorgan
collieries, perhaps the night-shift is working with never a hint
of the nameless dread that keeps us wakeful.</p>

<p>If I live through the night, I shall get out on the uplands
early in the morning. I know a trick or two of throwing a
hitch from tree to tree. With a stout rope I can climb one
of these wooded hillsides, even if it prove vertical! Then I
shall <em>breathe</em>!</p>

<p class="diarydate">3.50 <span class="meridienne">A.M.</span></p>

<p>I have just awakened with a grim and unalterable thought.
Confound Doctor Stephen Ashmill Aire for his subtle hints and
theories. If what he suggested this afternoon is true, that there
is some hidden means of access to the lawn, what awful
consequences are thrust into mind! Yes, if he is right, the
murderer may be one of those people who came rushing in from all
directions while we stood about Cosgrove’s body. I hesitate
to write their names, but it may be Belvoir or Bob Cullen or
Maryvale, for instance, or even one of the women, if in her
fury her arm became iron.</p>

<p>And that fiendish cat that has driven Maryvale mad and
that his bullets could not harm!</p>

<p>Worse and worse!</p>

<p>I shall now dress in tramping kit and doze until dawn.<a

I have postponed until now a note which should have been inserted
some pages ago, but which would then have interrupted the narrative. References
to <em>the song of the nightingale</em> in this chapter and elsewhere
in this diary demonstrate, as I think, the innocent romanticism of Mr.
Bannerlee. Neither he nor Mr. Maryvale appears to have possessed a
rudimentary knowledge of birds. Nightingales, to be sure, visit
Radnorshire, and the old ones do not leave until autumn, but of course their
descant ceases in <em>June</em>, when the task of feeding the young becomes
absorbing. Unquestionably, the bird these gentlemen listened to was
the song-thrush, which (as is well known) <em>resumes</em> its singing in
October, when the now-silent nightingale has departed from the land.

<h2>XV. <br> The Rainbow</h2>

<p class="diarydate">October 5. 10.18 <span class="meridienne">P.M.</span></p>

<p>I slipped on my rough shoes, thus completing my
toilet, scribbled a note for Crofts, and passed out of the door.
From the top of the stairs came a soft recurrent sound. Bob
Cullen had insisted on sentinelling outside Maryvale’s apartment
during the night; now the guardsman slept industriously, his
head reclining in the angle of the doorpost, the rest of him
curled up, his jaws alarmingly open.</p>

<p>Not disturbing him, I descended to the first storey, where I
placed my note under Crofts’ door, and continued down. My
previous night’s experience had taught me how to find the food
supply readily, and I stocked my pockets with concentrated
nutriment. Letting myself out by the front entrance, I turned
to the left and directed my steps toward the kitchen demesne
betwixt House and stables.</p>

<p>I was in luck. Twenty yards of fairly stout clothes-line
were mine for the taking.</p>

<p>With the rope bent over my arm, I hastened past the
dinner-room windows toward the cypresses that marked the first
point on any journey up the Vale. Then I stopped dead.</p>

<p>For a woman was standing by the far corner of the
conservatory, half-turned from me, looking at an object which
she held in her hand.</p>

<p>With her other hand she made a slight gesture to someone
around the corner, and the next moment I beat a swift retreat
to the shelter of a rank of low birch trees. A man in his shirt
sleeves dashed out from the behind the House, running like
mad. He was a man I had never seen before!</p>

<p>With great galloping strides, his arms working like pistons,
his knees rising incredibly high, he rushed straight for the
clump of cypresses; there he turned as sharply as his momentum
would permit and sped back to his starting point out of
my view.</p>

<p>He had come and gone so quickly that I had little chance to
take in his appearance. Decidedly, however, he was a long,
lank man, and there was a touch of red about his face in hair
and beard. But any attempt to mark him closely was defeated
by mere astonishment at his presence, and wonder, in the name
of reason, at what he was doing.</p>

<p>I quickly balanced the courses open to me. Should I reveal
myself and challenge these unknowns? Or return secretly to
the house and awake Crofts and Salt? Or continue my journey?</p>

<p>This last was what I did, for the cloaked woman happened
to turn her head in my direction, and I saw that she was one
of the Clays. Unless the Clays are to be relied on, no one is.
As for my curiosity, which was more than a little, I smothered
it. If the many perplexing incidents in the Vale have not by
this time chastened the inquisitiveness of each one of us, we
are difficult to school.</p>

<p>I went safe in the hiding of the birches until I reached the
unshorn grass of the summer-house park; the blades were loaded
with dew. While I crossed toward the regular path, I caught
sight of the unknown racing again in my direction, and was
half-alarmed for fear that he had espied me and was on my
trail. Once more, however, he turned beneath the cypresses
and fled back full tilt.</p>

<p>I had much to ponder on while I marched through the bleak
and clammy dawn, and pondering made the miles seem shorter.
I thought of Maryvale, who had walked here with me yesterday,
of his dark sayings and the blight upon his spirit—of
Doctor Aire, whose theorisings strike a vague discomfort into
my mind. He, by the way, has taken full responsibility for the
sudden madness of Maryvale. He blames himself for relating
the story of the man found decapitated near the summer-house.
That account, together with my yarn a little later about the
witch sisters and the subsequent failure of Maryvale to destroy
the cat, turned the balance of the unfortunate man’s intellect,
which had previously given token of a disposition towards
instability. The incredible fact that three bullets did not injure
the beast Aire says he cannot account for; yet I suspect him,
somehow, of keeping close counsel on the point.</p>

<p>But even with these matters to turn over and over in a
tussle of thought, constantly I kept wondering about the pair
on the lawn, the man from nowhere practising his uncouth
capers, the woman so intent on what she held in her hand.</p>

<p>I came to the spot where Salt and the others had parted
from Maryvale and me the evening before, and now I turned
aside too, for my determination was to cross the stream by the
fallen tree and to assault the eastern wall of the Vale. There
was no trouble in clambering along the improvised bridge; I
leaped to the ground and in ten minutes reached the steep base
of Great Rhos, prepared for an hour’s battle with the
densely-wooded slope.</p>

<p>Finally, wet to the waist as if I had waded a stream, I
emerged on the brow of the hill where the heatherstems lay
wriggling like the hair of a thousand Medusas. I walked
rapidly, waiting for the sun to break through and dry me, and
when it came soon afterward, I sat under a whinberry bush by
a bank of rare Welsh poppies and ate a few dried figs and a
piece of nut-bread for breakfast. From Shepherd’s Well nearby
I took a long draught.</p>

<p>The day promised to be glaring hot and abundantly clear
on the uplands, and doubtless steaming in the Vale. I passed
on to find some brink for reconnaissance. Among the hilltops,
what a difference a few feet may make in the prospect!</p>

<p>I found a place on the edge of the sheer flank of the north
of the Forest where the wide plains and fastnesses for miles
about were revealed in shimmering prospect. I reclined and
rested here for long, dried out thoroughly, and had luncheon:
two legs of chicken, a chunk of unsweetened chocolate, and an
orange which had wonderfully escaped crushing in my ascent.
While I ate, I looked at the cloud-flecked hills spread all about
in lovely confusion with fantastic writhen crests and crowns of
Silurian rock. They were scraped and clawed by rivers
channelling: Ithon and Clywedog and Wye gliding down their shady
courses with here and there among them a glimpse of hill-hung
woodlands, or church tower peeping over castle rise, or drowsy
village looking unchanged for centuries. Surely from Aidenn
Forest one could see the better half of Wales.</p>

<p>Of a sudden I slapped my thigh. “I’ll do it!”</p>

<p>My large-scale map of the Forest was in my pocket, as was
a map of greater scope, showing Wales and the western counties,
from which I could transfer the angles and make a fairly
good job of it. I would draw sighting lines on the Forest sheet,
so as to identify those magnificent and anonymous hills that
showed crags and colours from twenty, thirty, forty miles
away.</p>

<p>I was at the northern end of the Forest. Should I work here?
No, the sun had not yet driven the vapour from the remotest
peaks of which I wished to find the names. Besides, there was
no shelter near, and I saw some cool-looking groves on
Whimble. I headed south for Whimble.</p>

<p>Wryneck and woodlark sometimes came curiously past while
I worked on my maps under disadvantages, without table or
board; I had to fold one sheet for a straight-edge if I wished to
make a mark on the other. Sighting was difficult without a firm
plane surface. But I had enthusiasm, and patience. I fixed lines
pointing to mountains that, when I had found their names, for
the first time seemed real to me, Cader Idris, the Brecon
Beacons, many others—as the tracing I include here will
remind me when I look through these pages in later years.</p>

<p>I still had some cheese in my pocket. I ate it for tea.</p>

<p>Then out of the sultry day came a sudden dash of rain along
the hilltops, blotting out my mountains, and hedging in my
horizon to the profiles of the nearby slopes. I realized that the
copse of trees I occupied abutted the field where I had fled
from the bull. Fair shelter must be near.</p>

<p>I made short work of hastening across the field and climbing
down, this time, to the long broad ledge upon which I had
fallen on the other occasion. There I found refuge from the
weather, snugly ensconced on a lichenous seat of stone where
the slaty rock was hollowed out underneath the eyelid of the
hill. In my dim cubicle I laughed at the storm that was
sending down its battery of rain.</p>

<p>For the first time in the day, I bethought myself of smoking.
I had out pipe and tobacco, filled my pipe, and struck a match.
It flamed and died. I realized in an instant what a tragedy my
carelessness had caused.</p>

<p>That was my last match.</p>

<p>I would certainly have cursed myself in the limited number
of languages at my command, had not something I had seen in
that moment’s flare of the match caused me to catch my breath.</p>

<p>The little recess of the rocks where I had taken refuge was
filled with bracken and some coarse grass. The brief light had
shown me that at the rear of the cave, if I may call it so, the
sparser growth had been crushed down, thoroughly flattened—and
the impress was that of a human form. Someone had
used this place of late as his sleeping quarters!</p>

<p>I must have sat there stunned for several minutes before
I stirred, or even began to think. When I had gathered my wits,
it was not hard determining to get out of the place at once.
Was this sleeper the man who had shed Cosgrove’s blood? For
all that had been discovered, he might be. But whoever he was,
I had no wish to encounter him alone, and he might at that
very moment be hurrying this way to escape the rain.</p>

<p>The rain, to be sure, had almost ceased, a fact which did not
alter my determination to be quit of the ledge with all speed.
Half a minute later I was out of the shelter and clambering up
the bank, with my face set toward Mynydd Tarw’s gorsy
slopes. And now I watched the curving limits of the hills with
half-apprehensive keenness, expecting at any moment to see the
black dot of the unknown head rise into sight.</p>

<p>The shower had all but ceased; through a fine spray of rain
the sun came glinting. I looked across the Vale, over Great
Rhos. Ahead of me among the waste of hills beyond Aidenn
Forest the land was black with storm for leagues, save where
one great monument of light rested thirty miles away on Pen
Plinlimon-fawr. On that bleak mountain-top the zone of
splendour shone like a spot of hell touched by some ray of
heaven.</p>

<p>I had the impulse then to look the opposite way. Yes, as I
had surmised, to the south-east the meadows of Herefordshire
were steeped in sun. And through the gauzy air with its
wandering vapour-drops I saw a rainbow’s glittering bridge from
wooded slope to wooded slope across the mown hayfields, an
arch beneath which the distant Malvern Hills lifted their
profile against the sky.</p>

<p>I remembered then the great freedom and elation I had felt
when on the uplands only two days ago, and wished that among
these wonders that seemed spread for my eyes alone I might
regain that long ebullient rapture. But I could not. Why could
I not?</p>

<p>There I was with pipe and tobacco, perishing for a match!</p>

<p>Unless the cave-dweller whom I wished not to meet were
near, there was no other smoking creature within miles.</p>

<p>But stay! I suddenly remembered the men from Penybont,
repairing the one sole path to the uplands. If they had succeeded
in establishing a new trackway, there was my best route back
to Highglen House, toward which I must be tending, since the
hour was nearer five than four. And one of them must have a
match. If only they had not given over work for the day!</p>

<p>I had still a little distance to go north along the edge of
Mynydd Tarw before reaching the top of the path. Signs of
the landslide were not apparent here; yet I had made but one
of the hairpin bends when I saw a broad scar and scoop where
both earth and rock had torn asunder from the hill. Not until
I was half-way to the floor of the Vale did the course of the
landslide obliterate the zigzag path. The workers had not dug
all the earth and stone away, but had made a substantial
walking-surface some feet above the original one. And going a
little further down, I saw to my joy that the men had not yet
departed. They were not working, indeed, but standing about
some object on the ground at the foot of the hill—and I had a
premonition like a sword-cut what that object was.</p>

<p>It was the ill-clad, coatless body of the gorilla-man.</p>

<p>Not a quarter of an hour before, the men who had worked
to the very bottom of the path, where the wreckage of the
avalanche tailed away, had seen protruding from the earth a
long and hairy arm and purplish hand. A large stone weighted
down the body when it was found, and it appeared from the
position of the corpse, and particularly from the writhen
expression of the features, that the stranger had not been stricken
instantly to death. Instead, he may even have been some way
up the path when he had seen the hillside falling, and may have
fled and nearly escaped. The groping arm upthrust seemed an
indication that had not the heavy stone pinned him under, he
might have struggled to the air, instead of being buried alive.</p>

<p>“Did any of you know him?” I asked, looking down at the
face with its long, uncouth jaw and narrow temples.</p>

<p>“No, sir. He must have been a foreigner in these parts.”</p>

<p>“This is a bit sickening.” I certainly needed a pipe now.
“Who has a match?”</p>

<p>They were quite as doleful as I. “Sorry, sir, our matches
was all wet in the rain just now. Our coats was lyin’ up
beyond, and the shower got to ’em before we did. Matches are
fair ruined.”</p>

<p>I looked down at the ill-clad body. “By thunder, if I wouldn’t
rob a dead man for a match now. Were there any on
him?”</p>

<p>“Not a one, sir.” The men seemed to regard the idea as a
thing of abhorrence, and I had to laugh my question away as
a grim joke.</p>

<p>A couple of miles southward on the way home, I met the
two workmen who had gone to Highglen House for a shutter
on which to transport the body. Salt was with them, and all
three regarded me queerly, which was natural, for I was
carrying, besides the clothes-rope, the umbrella which I had
left in the ruin last night.</p>

<p>“Decided not to hang yourself?” asked Salt, his eye on the
rope.</p>

<p>I handed him the umbrella, which he received with puzzled
brow. “Item,” I said, “to prove the objective of the
menagerie-keeper.”</p>

<p>“Quite,” he responded. “Have you seen what we’re goin’
after?”</p>

<p>“I have. He was the first of the men I encountered that
night.”</p>

<p>“I guessed so. Well, this party’s out of it <em>al</em>together—time
and distance, you know, time and distance.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s so. Time and distance, the two greatest
villains that ever feazed the detective force. The landslide
certainly did not occur more than fifteen minutes after
Cosgrove’s death.”</p>

<p>“And this man was in it, was he?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Of course he was.”</p>

<p>“Not just buried there afterward, maybe?”</p>

<p>“I should say not. By the way, Superintendent, don’t go
without letting me have a match.”</p>

<p>“Not afraid of the dark, I hope?” Salt looked significantly
up among the trees, where the light was thickening.</p>

<p>“No, not exactly, but I’m famished for a smoke.”</p>

<p>“Smokin’ is not one of my virtues,” he responded. “I’m
sorry, sir; you’ll have to wait until you get to the House.”</p>

<p>I was angry, yes poisonously angry with Salt. It takes all
kinds of lunatics to make up a world, but is there any lunatic
as irritating as the man who doesn’t smoke?</p>

<p>I returned to the House, having all the while the awareness
that forms were following and eyes watching me in the
shadowy walks. To tell the merciless truth, these episodes of
the Unforthcoming Match had chagrined me so that my nerves
were teetering, and I had the uncomfortable sense that if I were
to step from the centre of the path or make any untoward
movement, something disagreeable might happen. I felt like a
prisoner, and even when I had emerged upon the lawn, I did
not like the way the black windows of the House stared at
me.</p>

<p>“Great heavens,” I thought, “am I coming under the thumbs
of the Influences, as Mrs. Belvoir called them?”</p>

<p>The Vale was dim when I reached the House. I knew that
I should surely find a match-holder on the mantel in the Hall
of the Moth. I did, but some other smoker had abstracted the
last match! I hope heaven’s ears were closed at that
moment.</p>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch16">

<h2>XVI. <br> Parchment—and Paper</h2>

<p>There was, of course, a match-holder in the library.
I looked into the room of weapons: although the light
shone beyond the library door ajar, no sound came from inside.
I thought the risk worth taking, and stepped in, rope and all,
hoping (in my grimed condition) not to discover anyone.</p>

<p>The quiet of the room was deceptive. There were a lot of
people there. Belvoir and Mrs. Belvoir were close together
at the table with its red velvet cover, reading from the same
book, which could not have been very fine sport for him, since
he required about one-half the time she did to peruse a page.
In the embrasure of the corner tower, Lord Ludlow was sitting
with his back to the window and his volume held before
his face so that no light from the chandelier might possibly
fall upon what he read. This position he maintained the entire
time I was in the room. In a secluded nook Lib and Bob were
standing before a glass-covered case full of dark and mysterious
tomes.</p>

<p>Belvoir looked up, while his wife began the page he had
finished. “Hello! Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“On top of the Forest—all over it: a breather. What’s
happened?”</p>

<p>“Man killed by the falling hill the other evening.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve seen him. I met Salt going up there. But down
here—what about Maryvale?”</p>

<p>“Quiet all day. He’s working hard—too busy to eat—fact.
(Finished it yet, my dear? Don’t hurry.)”</p>

<p>“Is he really painting?”</p>

<p>Belvoir shrugged. “Wish I knew. This morning, through
the door, he said he was, and warned us against interfering
with him. Aire’s standing by at present.”</p>

<p>“But have you thought—the materials. Oil pigments need
to be prepared. You can’t pick them up on instant’s notice after
a number of years, or decades, and find them suitable.”</p>

<p>“Salt showed us that yesterday’s dash was far from being
Gilbert’s first visit to the store-room. He had pottered there
quite a bit, and some colours he left behind in his frantic haste
are fit for immediate use.”</p>

<p>“He has painted before, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not in this generation. Long ago.”</p>

<p>“Pity. Did he say what he is working on?”</p>

<p>“No—no details. There’s another development, though. Did
Salt tell you?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing.”</p>

<p>“You remember Sir Brooke?”</p>

<p>“Do I?”</p>

<p>“Well, that same useful road-mender who kept the vigil in
the car last evening was interviewed in person by Salt about
noon to-day.”</p>

<p>“But how—”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ve rigged up a practicable bridge for one person
at a time down where the old one stood. Salt crossed it
unscathed. (Very well, my dear. Carry on. I’ll catch up with
you.)”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Two nights ago the road-mender saw Sir Brooke as sure
as taxes, crossing the bridge and proceeding up the road toward
the House. (I agree with you, my dear. It’s infernally dull.
But Carlyle was a great man.)”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! We’re closing in on him.”</p>

<p>“I wish they’d leave off tracing that old boy,” said a peevish
young feminine voice from the corner. “He’s old enough to
take care of himself. I wish somebody’d trace my tennis balls.”</p>

<p>“Why,” I smiled, “what’s happened to them?”</p>

<p>“The usual death,” said Lib. “Bob knocked both of ’em into
the Water this afternoon and presto vanisho! Now we can’t
play any more until somebody goes into town and pries a few
loose from the corner store.”</p>

<p>“Gee, he’s got nerve, that butler,” urged Bob, turning his
plus-foured self toward me, and more toward the light, so
that his somewhat pug-like countenance showed the full
measure of affronted innocence. “You know what he said, Mr.
Bannerlee? He said that it served us right because we played
tennis so soon after Mr. Cosgrove died—Cosgrove!”</p>

<p>“It served you right because you thought my side of the
court was in the next county,” Lib snapped. “Now what can
we do, except read?”</p>

<p>“There are worse things,” I offered mildly.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’re looking for over there—a good book,”
exclaimed the youth.</p>

<p>“Well, these are just a little too rich for your taste, I fancy,”
I remarked. I scanned the titles behind the glass; I had not
examined this case before. The shelves were not quite
comfortably filled with bound volumes of learned periodicals and
manuscripts in expensive leather covers, all having their titles
impressed in bright gilt.</p>

<p>“Hullo, now there’s a thing.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked both juveniles at once, alert for something,
even literature, to break the monotony of their existence.</p>

<p>I pointed to a cover with the words “MS. Elis Gruffydd”
stamped upon it. “Evidently a copy of part of a historical
manuscript I once read. If I remember rightly, it contains a passage
about this house.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, it does?”</p>

<p>“You’re a wonder,” declared Lib, with her nose pressed
against the glass. “Why, we had that one down and gave it the
once over. It was all Welsh to us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I mean in translation,” I hastily amended. “Don’t
credit me with any knowledge of Cumraeg.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a rag?”</p>

<p>“The Welsh language,” I explained. “But I should think
you’d find better hunting on those shelves over there.”</p>

<p>“Those? They look sort of dull.”</p>

<p>“I realize that the volumes are not provided with art-jackets
in three colours depicting the discovery of slaughtered
bodies and the rescue of lovely women, but behind those drab
covers reside the works of Jane Austen, Scott, and the Brontës,
Thackeray, Dickens—and Wilkie Collins!”</p>

<p>“Christopher! Seems to me I’ve read something quite hot by
Wilkie Collins. Thanks, Mr. Bannerlee, I’ll take a look.”</p>

<p>Alone, then, at the case in the obscure corner, I opened the
glass doors and ran my eye over the titles at close range.
“Old Watts,” as everyone styles him, had been something of
a bibliophile, and I saw what I believed to be a number of
absolute rarities, quite thrown away on Crofts, of course. I
had reached my hand up to a dark corner, where a couple of
volumes were lying on their sides, when an exclamation from
my lips brought Lib back from Wilkie Collins at once.</p>

<p>“That was a strong one. What’s the matter? See a snake up
there?”</p>

<p>“No, but I found a mighty startling book,” I answered,
looking around and noticing with relief that probably only Lib
had heard my exclamation. Bob and the Belvoirs had departed,
and Lord Ludlow was holding his page so close to his face that
I supposed him insensible to external stimuli.</p>

<p>“What’s the big kick here?” she asked, looking at the little
old book I had plucked from the shelf and whose age-tawny
pages I was scrabbling through.</p>

<p>“If Crofts knew what a hoard he has in this library! Why,
two or three of these quartos must be worth their weight in
diamonds.”</p>

<p>“Boy! What a chance! I’d sneak a couple away; only they
all look worth a thin dime to me. What’s this one you’re
palpitating about?”</p>

<p>“This is the volume responsible for my being here, Miss
Dale. ‘The Book of Sylvan Armitage,’ imprint 1598. What
do you think of that!”</p>

<p>She was holding the quarto to the light, screwing up her
face while her eyes roved across the page. Something flickered
to the floor. I stooped and picked it up: a flake of moss.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” I said. “Some servant nodded when he
dusted here. Well, how do you like it?”</p>

<p>“Too many f’s. I get all tangled up reading.”</p>

<p>“Those aren’t f’s; they’re s’s. You’ll get used to them soon.
Poor Cosgrove would have revelled in this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cosgrove. Funny things he revelled in.” Suddenly she
snapped the quarto closed, and gave a careful look toward the
harmless Ludlow, whose book was still held defiantly against
the light, shutting out the universe. She lowered her voice.
“Say, Mr. Bannerlee, remember the day I came down here, the
way Cosgrove was watching me, like a fish?”</p>

<p>Before I could put in a restraining word, she began a hasty
whispered account of events occurring some months ago, when
Cosgrove, already engaged to Paula Lebetwood, met Lib for
the first time at Coventry. Unquestionably, the orthodox Irishman
had been shocked at the daring dress, behaviour, and speech
of this insouciant American minx. Mingled with his disapproval,
however, was a strong spell of attraction which caused
him to be constantly hanging about in her presence. I believe
that just as the element of unexpectedness in Miss Lebetwood’s
broadly capable character was in a large measure responsible
for his desire for her, why here in this alert, sharp wasp of a
girl, was also something Cosgrove had not experienced before,
something tantalizing that would not let him be at peace. His
attentions to Lib, so I gathered from her story, had grown
more obnoxious as the days went by, and reached their climax
one evening when by her bad luck he happened to find her
alone at the far end of one of the gardens.</p>

<p>I had some difficulty at this point in following the extraordinary
language of Miss Dale, especially since her speech now
became spiced with a good many terms expressive of emotion.
But it is clear enough that Cosgrove, detaining her in spite of
her unambiguous complaints, entered into a long exhortation
over her, more like a fanatical Puritan than a son of the Church.
At first Lib had been bewildered, then frightened, for mingled
with the Irishman’s obloquy was a strain which at first she
could not comprehend at all, but soon realized was an appeal
to “make his banner her banner,” an invitation of no uncertain
tenour to “ride by his side through the high places of the
world.” The union of repulsion and fascination under which
he must have laboured, as shown in this outburst, was
identical with what I had observed on his face at the luncheon
table.</p>

<p>“And that’s the kind of a bozo Cosgrove was,” perorated
Lib. “That’s the blighter (isn’t that what you say?) that
everybody around here thinks was lily-white. That’s the
Eringobragh that Paula’s eating her heart out on account of
his death!”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Do I? Don’t I! Say, I know Paula. She’s the best kid on
this little ol’ earth. Bannerlee, my boy, just because I like to
talk like a fool half the time and can’t get back on the rails the
rest, don’t get me wrong. I love Paula: I have ever since when
I was dressed in a towel and she used to keep me from breaking
my neck a dozen times every day. What I mean is, I know
Paula. She hasn’t been natural for months, not since she got
engaged to this devil. She was a darn good sport and peppy all
day long, not one of these heavy thinkers. But ever since this
Cosgrove got so big on the horizon, she’s been worrying for
him—you know—the ‘King in Ireland’ stuff—or worrying <em>about</em>
him—the dog! And since somebody polished him off with
that rock, instead of feeling better, she’s acting so quiet and
intense I’m scared to death. Honestly, I’ve been crazy-scared.
Last night she just sat and thought. I hardly slept last night.
I heard you going downstairs awfully early this <span class="meridienne">A.M.</span>”</p>

<p>“I wish I could help. But you see it’s so peculiarly and
emphatically a situation where I can do nothing.”</p>

<p>“I know it, I know it,” she acquiesced mournfully. “Gee,
though, I wish she’d fall in love with you or something like
that. I wish she’d take her mind off that Irishman. To think, he
got so fresh with me, and then he went and bounced one off
Mr. Oxford’s jaw.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Sure; didn’t you know? He got sort of green-eyed about
Oxey. Maybe he had a right to; I don’t know. I mean I don’t
know about Oxey; he did seem to be around a lot of the time.
Paula wouldn’t look at him, of course. Then Cosgrove hung
one on Oxey’s jaw, and we thought we’d seen the last of him.
But Oxey shows up here last week smooth as ever—hadn’t
given up hope, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I must tidy myself a bit for dinner. I wish I could help
you, Lib. You mustn’t worry.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’m making things out worse than they are.” She
took up the Book of Sylvan Armitage. “I’ll plunge into this
exciting narrative, and try to make some head or tail out of it.”
And just as I was going out of the door, she called with a
flash of her usual impudence: “What’s that you’re smuggling
under your coat?”</p>

<p>“My shoulders,” I laughed.</p>

<p>“You must have the hump, then,” she rejoined, and when
I was at the stair-foot, I heard her cry, “Oh, look what I’ve
found!” but I did not return to learn of her discovery.</p>

<p>Nor did I immediately ascend to my room. In truth, one
reason why I left the library was that I had heard voices in
the portrait-corridor: one tone was Crofts’, the other a strange,
high-keyed speech I had never heard before. To learn whose
voice this was I had retreated from Lib and her find.</p>

<p>I stole to the front entrance, opened the door with the
cat-head knocker, peeped out. A dozen yards away my host was
saying good-bye to the red-headed, red-bearded young man I
had seen cavorting on the lawn at early day-break. The stranger
now wore a blue suit of provincial tailoring and sported a huge
yellow flower in his buttonhole. A moment later they parted,
Crofts with a wave of the hand, the youth with a respectful
salute. The owner of Highglen House then walked around
past the library in the direction of the Hall of the Moth.</p>

<p>I noiselessly gained the lawn and followed the youth, who
wandered with an air of negligence across the grounds by a
shrubbery path which soon was lost in the grove beneath
Whimble. Among the trees I ventured to draw closer to him,
and was nearly discovered in consequence. For when I slipped
around a stout oak to creep upon him, I caught him lying or
rather rolling on the other side, convulsed with silent mirth!
I marched backward on tiptoes, collided with a tree, and
returned to the House.</p>

<p>After a plunge in the bath which Aire has kindly invited me
to share, and after such improvement of my dress as my tramping
kit afforded, I knocked on Crofts’ door and had the secret
out of him. He was waging a pitched battle with some
shirt-studs, and would have told me anything in return for my
relief.</p>

<p>“That red-haired chap? Foggins’ new man. He came
‘sweetheartin’ ’ this afternoon, and I had a little talk with
him.”</p>

<p>“But who is Foggins, and how does his new man come to be
here at break of day? How does he come to be here at all?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ve slung a footbridge over the Water down below.
Finished late last night. Foggins sells us our milk. What do
you mean by ‘break of day?’ ”</p>

<p>“I saw this milk carrier dashing like a red streak across the
lawn when I set out this morning.”</p>

<p>“You did! So did I.”</p>

<p>“You!”</p>

<p>“I heard him coming round the House past Alberta’s room,
while I lay awake at some ungodly early hour. I looked out,
saw he was carrying a pair of spiked shoes in one hand, the milk
can in the other. That looked queer. So I got into a pair of
slippers and my dressing-gown and went to the upper end of the
passage on this floor, intending to go out of the door and down
the outside flight of steps to find what was up. But I saw
everything through the glass. Rosa Clay—”</p>

<p>“Ah, Rosa!”</p>

<p>“You see (I got all this from the young chap himself just
now) since this house-party began Rosa and Ardelia have been
a little huffy over this man Morgan. Ardelia seems to bear away
the prize; so for spite Rosa has begun to walk out a bit with
this young fellow—seems a good enough young fellow.”</p>

<p>“And why the athletic exhibition?”</p>

<p>“The way of a man with a maid—showing his prowess. Prides
himself on being something of a runner, says he possesses a
number of cups and medals won at fairs and such by fleetness of
foot. In fact, this afternoon he showed me his card of
membership in the Brecon and Radnor Young Men Mercurys.”</p>

<p>“Ah, now I know what she had in her hand!”</p>

<p>He gaped; this was new to him. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“She was holding his stop-watch on him.”</p>

<p>“Curious. His voice reminded me of something, too.”</p>

<p>I remembered the laughter-spasm of the youth beneath the
tree, but forebore just then to plague my host with new
vexation.</p>

<p>The dinner-gong rang. While we passed down the stairs,
I recalled our words of last evening on this flight of steps.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Crofts, has the great Harry Heatheringham of
Worcester wired you his solution of these riddles?”</p>

<p>“He has not, but unless the fool who took my ’phoned telegram
at the Post Office bungled it in transmission he has the
facts.”</p>

<p>“I look forward to seeing him.”</p>

<p>“So do I. Good Lord, the night you dropped in on us, Bannerlee,
I thought this was Lost Man’s Vale. Sir Brooke omitted
to appear, as you know; but I had already been waiting three
days for Heatheringham!”</p>

<p>“Three days!”</p>

<p>“Since the Parson Lolly trouble had become serious. I had
sent word for him to come as a guest; he had accepted. And
until yesterday’s wire, I haven’t heard another word from
him.”</p>

<p>It was rather low of me, but I could not resist the second
temptation to prod Crofts a little. I said:</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t mind my pointing out that you haven’t a
particle of proof that wire came from Heatheringham at all, or
that your message actually reached him, or that he’s alive. How
can you tell that you haven’t been betraying secrets to some
unknown enemy, or at least to some shrewd newspaper
reporter?”</p>

<p>My host seemed to shrink to about half his size.</p>

<p>To-night’s dinner was the first orderly meal since Cosgrove’s
death. It was good to see people eating again with the
suggestion of appetite. Even Miss Lebetwood had come down and
had lost her tense, restrained look of earlier hours. Opposite
me, Lib, most fresh and radiant, more genuinely girlish than
I can remember her before, smiled on me mystifyingly.</p>

<p>The men had reverted to the English fashion of remaining
behind the ladies. When we rose from the table I buttonholed
Salt.</p>

<p>“Superintendent, does your censorship permit a letter to go
out of the Vale once in a while?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re jokin’ me, sir. What is it this time?”</p>

<p>“No, seriously,” I showed him an envelope containing a
note I had scratched off in my room. “I want to send this to
Balzing to-night for my own copy of Sylvan Armitage. That’s
an old book I’ve discovered in the library here.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! and you want another copy? One for each
eye?”</p>

<p>“Quite so; for comparison.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Mr. Bannerlee. Carry on.”</p>

<p>No sooner had we joined the women in the Hall, where a
fire was lighted against the chill of evening, than Lib darted
toward me, took my hand, led me to a small shaky-legged
walnut cabinet, one of the objects which decorate but most
inadequately furnish the room. An ornamental ebony box rested
on the cabinet, and lifting the box cover, Lib revealed the
Book of Sylvan Armitage.</p>

<p>“Prepare for a great shock,” she said, slyly glancing about
to ensure we were not observed. “You should have waited
a minute before you skipped out of the library. Aren’t I
clever? I’ll bet your copy at Balzing hasn’t one of these
gadgets.”</p>

<p>While she spoke she had opened the cover of the quarto, a
cover which looked to be unusually thick. The slim pink fingers
of her left hand were prying, then disappeared beneath the
edge of the book, and I saw that the apparent thickness of the
cover was due to the fact that a pocket of paper had been
pasted to the board with cunning, but with no special secrecy.
From the receptacle she drew two folded pages, one
age-stained, the other much younger, even rather new.</p>

<p>“See that!” she bade in a Gargantuan whisper, thrusting
before my face the yellowed sheet, which was calf-skin. “Read
that!”</p>

<p>“But it’s in Welsh, and the parchment looks at least two
centuries old.”</p>

<p>“Oh, absolutely—but this goes with it.” She handed me the
other piece, and stood beaming, her smile including and
enlivening every feature of her already brisk countenance. I could
not help smiling back, and it was several seconds before I could
turn my glance to the white sheet of ordinary folio paper, whose
close script was legible enough.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t mean such a much to a low-brow like me,” I
heard her say. “But if that’s not some modern shark’s translation
of what’s written on the skin of the fatted calf, I’ll eat the
calf-skin. What about it?”</p>

<p>I would have needed only a comparison of the proper names
in the first few lines of each writing to assure me that it was
so, had it not been the obvious conclusion, on the face of it.
Lib had discovered an unpublished document, or part of a
document, connected with Highglen House.</p>

<p>Two minutes later I had informed the company of the
circumstances, and the Hall was as still as a vacuum. When I
realized that all these people were listening to hear me read
from the paper I held in my hand, my undisciplined hand
shook. It is horrible to be nervous, and have to betray it.</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders and kept my hand as steady as
possible. Here goes:</p>

<blockquote class="document">

  <p>“ ‘. . . in some fear of being ill-received in Cwm Melin, for
  the lord there had the name of an intemperate man, one savage
  to strangeness when the humour was upon him. But mammering
  was more harm than use in the pass to which I had come,
  and save in that stronghold I had no surety of shelter from
  the snow, the town of New Aidenn lying some uncertain
  number of miles beyond the Cwm. Increasing storm and cold
  compelled me to seek kind reception within the castle, avouching
  truly that I was a person who had lost his way in those wilds
  and stood in danger of the elements. Being admitted within
  the gate and taken before my lord, I was excellently welcomed.
  The man himself sat alone before the blazing hearth in a room
  called the Hall of the Moth, with weapons and machines
  and all the abiliments of war heaped in the corners. He was
  none of your pouncing and mincing followers of court, but
  sprawled like a great bulchin in his chair, with ragged
  Abram-coloured beard, immense mouth, and eyes like yellow flames.
  He bawled for sewer and cup-bearer, and a table was straight
  fetched, and a feast-dish set thereon, with a manchet and good
  sherris wine a-plenty. I fell to my refreshment, nor did it
  escape my notice that my lord was somewhat in his cups, which
  caused him to be exceeding merry and boastful. He vaunted
  long about himself and his own great valour and prowess,
  exulting mightily in his late triumph over Roger, Earl of
  Gwrtheyrnion, which was truly an achievement which will
  redound in the history of time. Much he said that is known
  among men, and presently fell to speech of Sir Pharamond,
  fourth lord of that name, who builded this castle on the mill-site,
  after his house close under the valleytop had tumbled to its
  fall through the perfidy of the false steward David, a most foul
  and dastardly act, published far and wide among men. Very
  gleefully and asperly did my lord relate how they had skummed
  the countryside for the scroyle, and how they had meted out his
  fearful fate. Now my lord waxed more strange and withal
  crafty in his words, saying that which is not of common report,
  relating how above the newly builded battlements Sir
  Pharamond had made a tier of chambers, so that rumour whispered
  he was mad—but lord Pharamond only smiled, and called the
  windows of those chambers his eyes for descrying treachery.
  And ever afterward, said my noble host, the builder of the
  castle on the mill-site was untroubled by plotters against his
  peace. Now when I was emboldened to ask my lord to make
  this thing clear, he said no word but seized a flambeau up into
  his hand and beckoned me to follow. He led me through the
  kitchens and down into a cavern that was there, with a
  standing pool of water in the midst. This, said my lord, is the
  drowning-pit of my ancestor, for it was his merry mood to
  fling his disobedient folk into the water with his own hand,
  not binding them, but pressing them back into the pit while
  they essayed to come ashore. Thirty he had once drowned in a
  single afternoon. For the rest, were he werry, he could shuffle
  them off with no more trouble than snuffing a night-light.
  Now do you see, said my lord, but in such cunning wise that
  I knew some deceit lurked behind his words. Nor would he
  say more, but departed from the vault, leaving me constrained
  to follow him or remain in darkness, though wishful to
  examine the cavern—yet full of thanks, on the other hand, that
  he had not practised upon me the custom of his ancestor.</p>

  <p>Again in the Hall of the Moth my lord laughed immoderately
  before the fire, saying that for that gear he himself
  was proof against all traitordom, for he kept there a cat
  that was never tamed, more sure than forty watch-dogs, more
  trusty than twenty men-of-war, since that it leaped to the
  attack without a snarl or a struggle, full silently and suddenly,
  until it had achieved the kill, and it failed not to lay his
  enemy low. Beware, said my lord, of gib my cat’s claw, and
  how you hear the purring of the cat, for its purr is more
  dangerous than the innumerable growl of hounds upon a
  hunting. The purring of gib my cat means death. I dared to ask
  that I might be shown this beast, provided it purred not at
  me. My lord, who had drunk much more wine since we had
  come from the cavern of the drowning-pit, bade me thickly go
  seek the beast for myself, and upon asking where, he bade me
  look beneath the perfidious tree, but beware lest it purr or I
  was doomed. So I said no more of it, discerning that while
  he grew the more merry he grew the more savage, and might
  well be goading me on to my destruction. At length my lord
  having fallen into a stupor, he was borne to his bed, and I
  conducted to mine, among those upper rooms which rose above
  the battlements. I slept sound, awakened but once, as I
  thought, by a long belch of laughter from some unknown part
  of the castle. Again sleep visited me, and in the morning, when
  the snow had ceased, a party of my lord’s men being at point
  of breaking away to New Aidenn, I made one of their company
  and reached my destination in soundness, the afternoon being
  that of the fourteenth day of January, 1523.’ ”<a href="#note4"
  id="noteref4">¹</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>“Well,” avouched Mrs. Bartholomew, almost before I had
completed the last sentence, “now we know the ancestry of that
frightful animal.”</p>

<p>“The cat of the Delambres, you mean?” asked Belvoir.</p>

<p>“Yes. No wonder the Frenchwomen left it behind and Mr.
Maryvale’s bullets couldn’t kill it.”</p>

<p>“The cat’s claw, eh?” mused Belvoir. “ ‘Beware of the cat’s
claw.’ Funny, Superintendent, that the Lord of Aidenn and
Parson Lolly should use the same words.”</p>

<p>“I wish someone would tell me,” said I, “what is a
perfidious tree.”</p>

<p>“I should like to know, too,” Alberta declared, “and what’s
more, why anybody should keep a cat under one.”</p>

<p>“I wish Mr. Maryvale <em>had</em> annihilated that fiendish cat,” said
Mrs. Bartholomew. “It gives me a shiver whenever I think of
it somewhere up there, maybe waiting for one of us.”</p>

<p>Pendleton looked towards Miss Lebetwood and lowered his
voice. “Why, you don’t mean to say that you think the beast
had anything to do with Cosgrove’s death?”</p>

<p>“Cats don’t usually hit people with stones,” contributed
Bob.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” called Ludlow sharply. “Fiendish cat, flying
Parson, perfidious tree, deathless arm, mystic bone, and all
balderdash!”</p>

<p>“Very well, my Lord,” said Salt, who appeared ready to
indulge in a little crossing of swords, “explain this tragedy
without the balderdash.”</p>

<p>“Explain it <em>with</em>!” retorted his Lordship.</p>

<p>The documents had been passing from hand to hand. “My
Lord, I’ll have a look at that manuscript, if you’ve finished,”
said Salt. “No, I mean the English-written one.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t it.”</p>

<p>“But I thought—”</p>

<p>“I did have it a moment ago. I gave it to—er—”</p>

<p>“You laid it down on the mantelpiece. I saw you,” said
Alberta.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; so I did. But it’s not there.”</p>

<p>Salt raised his voice. “Who has the English manuscript?”</p>

<p>No response, until a gasp from Bob. “Look, isn’t that it?—in
the fire!”</p>

<p>Something ashen and fluffy was smouldering on top of the
log, something that turned from grey to translucent pink
when the flame brightened. Salt reached the fireplace in a leap,
bent down, scrutinized the fragment.</p>

<p>“That’s it, sure enough.” He ever so carefully attempted
to remove the crinkled piece, which vanished at the first
touch of the fire-shovel.</p>

<p>Crofts extended the parchment in mollifying wise. “At any
rate,” he said, “we have the original here. No trouble having a
new translation made.”</p>

<p>Salt swelled like a small balloon, and his jaw was tight. “No,
thank you, Mr. Pendleton. I’m not having any.”</p>

<p>I heard Aire’s suppressed exclamation behind me: “Of course
not!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I demanded, turning to the dark,
outlandish face that came only to my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Why, Salt wants the manuscript because he wants the man
who wrote it: someone, probably, who has lived here or been
here before, knew the book, knew the Welsh language, and,
particularly, whose penmanship is that of the paper.”</p>

<p>Crofts, crestfallen, was still urging the original parchment.
“At any rate, Superintendent, take charge of this. The
burning must have been an accident; perhaps the sheet fell in
the fire. And you can have another trans—”</p>

<p>Salt took, or rather snatched, the sheep-skin from Crofts, as
much as to say, “Better this than nothing,” and he did say, “I
don’t want <em>any</em> translation; I want that particular one.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” murmured Aire. “Whoever wrote that paper
is Parson Lolly!”</p>

It may be necessary, in view of the occurrence later in the evening

<p class="diarydate">October 6. 11.25 <span class="meridienne">A.M.</span></p>

<p>Was he, I wondered, in the room at all? So far, since
eight o’clock, I had not been able to detect the slightest sound
from within the chamber. For longer and longer periods I
listened with my ear to the door, all senses alert. I thought of
knocking, but refrained, for Aire had counselled against it. But
that inhuman stillness inside the room!</p>

<p>Suddenly footsteps resounded crossing the floor, no secret
footsteps, but blatant and decisive ones. I had hardly time to
draw back a little from the entrance when the door opened
and Maryvale stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>I was shocked, for with the exception of two days’ bristle he
looked so much himself. When he saw me, he tossed his head
back in a laugh that had the natural ring.</p>

<p>“Ah, you, Mr. Bannerlee. I wondered which of the
gentlemen was protecting me this morning.”</p>

<p>Yes, he seemed quite the same as when I had first met him
and we paced the walk outside the Hall of the Moth. Quiet and
courteous, sane and substantial, he smiled on my
embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming in? You’ve had a long wait.”</p>

<p>I was trying to meet his cheerful eye and to think at the same
time. “I should rather expect you’d wish to come out.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you; I have been out.”</p>

<p>“You have? No one told me.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” he said with his fluent ease of manner.
“Last night my oils weren’t quite right, and I looked for some
common varnish in the stable supply room.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I laughed, “I should think you’d have thought of
food before varnish.”</p>

<p>“True, I have not been eating very heartily. Some carrots and
raw cabbage from the kitchen garden was all I could obtain.
The darkness rather hindered me.”</p>

<p>“But I heard nothing of this. Who let you out?”</p>

<p>“Let me out? My dear sir, I go out when I choose, by the
window!”</p>

<p>“But you couldn’t have climbed down the wall.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bannerlee, we seldom know our latent powers. What
I set myself to do, I do. It is a great deal easier than you
suppose when the windows have cornices and the ivy is
reasonably firm.”</p>

<p>“But climbing back?”</p>

<p>“You have observed the ladder, of course. For the present,
I find it obviates much of the difficulty. Later—” His voice
trailed out, and he changed the subject with a renewed
invitation to enter. “I am glad it is you who are the first to
see my work. I think you will know how to evaluate it.”</p>

<p>Perhaps I was not prudent, but I was bitterly curious to see
what was the product Maryvale had taken extraordinary
measures to create. I stepped inside, noted the broad,
slant-shouldered room to be in order, saw lying across a chair the
thin sword, a mere rapier, with which the man had threatened
to make a ghost of any who interrupted him. A stout walking-stick
would have smashed the blade to splinters in a twinkling.
The bed had not been slept in, or on. The only litter in the
room was near the casement, where easel and canvas stood
and rags and brushes were scattered on the floor.</p>

<p>“The pigments are not dry yet, of course,” said Maryvale.
“Still, the work is done.”</p>

<p>Maryvale’s canvas was about four feet each way, and save
for an irregular space in the centre, every inch had been
drawn and coloured with minute care. Almost it might be
said that the one derogatory criticism was that overloaded
detail diminished the interest of the principal subject. For the
picture was no mere daub of good intentions. Though even
my inexpert eye saw deficiencies in technique, they were
faults due to a long unpractised hand—they were nothing.
Once on a time, indeed, Maryvale must have studied his art
to advantage, for now in spite of imperfect materials at his
command, and in spite of long unacquaintance with the medium,
the power of his idea overrode the difficulties, and the
magnificent though intentionally uncompleted painting drove
its impression home.</p>

<p>Only, as I have said, the background and lesser adjuncts
demanded a greater share of interest than usual. A peculiar
circumstance abetted this fact. The central figure had no
face.</p>

<p>The scene was above a valley so deep that its bottom was
lost in darkness, where the whole middle air was drenched
with rain to the colour of smoke, through which the sun,
westering and low, sent a shaft of dripping light. Higher,
against a black and sullen mountain-side, the thunder-heads
were gathered in inky monochrome, and down the sky wriggled
a huge worm of lightning, so dazzling that it affected the eye
with torture keen as that which a loud shrill sound inflicts
upon the ear. And round about, outside the clouds and within
them, flickered the suggestions of menacing shapes, skinny
arms, abysmal eyes, demonic smiles.</p>

<p>In the centre, a solitary figure hung in the track of the
storm, not upright, not poised as if for swooping flight, but
horizontal in the turgid air, resting with four limbs
widespread, like some unholy ghost brooding over the nether
gulfs of hell—Parson Lolly. The pitch-black cloak flapped
restless in the tempest, and from the indistinguishable murk
below came up the scarlet gleams from unknown forges.</p>

<p>Parson Lolly’s neck was twisted upward and the face turned
toward the beholder, save that there was no face. Examining
closely, I saw that not the faintest lines had been drawn for
one, that Maryvale had simply ceased at that place in his
design. The sinister suggestion was enforced by the bulk of the
decapitated figure against the livid storm, by the hands with
their hint of feline claws, by the shadows cast downward by
those hands, like the doom of pestilence scattered down the
gulf.</p>

<p>The artist stood by the window, his back to the light, but I
could see the high glint of satisfaction in his eye.</p>

<p>“You <em>do</em> approve, I can tell.”</p>

<p>“Maryvale, this is—well, it’s beyond anything I expected.
Where did you study?”</p>

<p>“Two years with Coselli in Milan. But that was long ago;
I could not have done this then.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about the face?”</p>

<p>“I doubt that I shall ever finish it,” he said, looking at
his handiwork. “No.” He shook his head and his eyes contracted
to points of light. “It may be the only picture I shall
ever paint—”</p>

<p>“Surely not!” I cried with much feeling. “You have the
incommunicable gift.”</p>

<p>But Maryvale was far aloof. His voice had changed into
that distant tone that suggested withdrawal beyond the sphere
of ordinary mortals. And when he spoke, I became as cold
as ice.</p>

<p>“I know now why Cosgrove passed away, with all the
embroilments and hubbub he used to cause.”</p>

<p>I responded with a sense of rigid self-control: “You aren’t,
er, implying he terminated his own existence?”</p>

<p>“He was killed so that I could paint. When all this excitement
and investigation is over, that is what they will find.
I think it is well his life is ended.”</p>

<p>“Come now, Mr. Maryvale, without cavil or casuistry, tell
me who performed this beneficial murder.”</p>

<p>“Someone, I do not know who, of the house of Kay.”</p>

<p class="diarydate">Same day. 4.30 <span class="meridienne">P.M.</span></p>

<p>For some reason the Superintendent appeared highly gratified
and very lenient toward the universe. Alberta Pendleton,
though perhaps no more curious than the rest of the table,
was the only one who ventured to find out why. Wheedling,
she persisted from the fish to the fruit, and at length wore out
Salt’s defences by attrition.</p>

<p>The table grew still while the Superintendent opened a
wallet capable of holding a couple of folios and very carefully
withdrew a piece of notepaper which he held by a sheath
of blotter fastened with a clip.</p>

<p>“Take it by the corner, <em>if</em> you please, and mind it don’t
catch fire. That was a neat trick somebody played on me last
evening, but I’ll thank you not to repeat it,” he admonished
a trifle grimly, opening the note and handing it to Mrs.
Bartholomew, whose eyes grew twice their size within two seconds
while they were fixed on the writing.</p>

<p>“What does it say?” chorused half a dozen voices, but Mrs.
Bartholomew could only give a huge swallow and an audible
sigh, and handed the paper to Maryvale without looking at
him.</p>

<p>“Read it to us,” besought Crofts, who sat at the far end of
the table and whose turn would not come for at least a couple
of minutes.</p>

<p>Maryvale complied. “ ‘Sir,—Will no plain speech cause you
or your principals to understand that the die is cast and the
snowball is rolling downhill!’ ” A long low whistle broke from
the reader’s lips.</p>

<p>“Go on!” (from Crofts.)</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Maryvale, that’s not fair!”</p>

<p>“Don’t stop, please.”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, go on!”</p>

<p>“I will go on,” said the man of business. “ ‘My deeds be on
my head!’ ”</p>

<p>After that perhaps prophetic sentence the silence seemed
to sway and swirl. Alberta asked in a small voice, “Is that
all?”</p>

<p>“No, there is another paragraph, equally concise: ‘I have
acquainted Mr. Oxford sufficiently with the particulars, and
I do not see that there is any need for you and me to discuss
the situation. It remains simply for you to take what measures
you consider best, or to accept the inevitable. You cannot stem
the tide.’ ”</p>

<p>About twenty-four startled eyes suddenly turned full glare
on Charlton Oxford.</p>

<p>“No signature?” asked Aire.</p>

<p>“Yes, the message is signed ‘Lancelot,’ and a postscript
adds, ‘These notes and their method of delivery are an
unnecessary risk. I suggest that your answer be the last, since on
my side the question is past debate.’ That <em>is</em> the end.”</p>

<p>Oxford sat between Miss Mertoun and Lib Dale, on my side
of the board. Lib promptly struck a finger into his waistcoat,
so that he squirmed, while the English girl looked at her
cousin with wide wonder, or a clever imitation of it, in her fine
black eyes.</p>

<p>“What in thunder have <em>you</em> got to do with this mess?”
demanded Pendleton.</p>

<p>“Yes, Oxey, old sport,” appended Lib, “what’s all this secret
stuff? Are you a great man and we didn’t know it all the
time?”</p>

<p>But Oxford, his eyes very uncomfortable, made no answer
than to shrug his modish shoulders, and Salt came to his
rescue.</p>

<p>“Don’t press Mr. Oxford, if you please. He is bound in
confidence to me.”</p>

<p>“This, I believe, is an admissible question,” said Aire. “Is
the note a recent discovery of yours?”</p>

<p>“Found it an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“But surely you couldn’t have overlooked it in your
previous search in Mr. Cosgrove’s room.”</p>

<p>“Right you are. But I didn’t discover this in Mr. Cosgrove’s
room.”</p>

<p>“Oh?”</p>

<p>“No. It had been delivered.”</p>

<p>“Delivered? What the devil do you mean?” asked Crofts.</p>

<p>“It was put where Sir Brooke told Mr. Cosgrove to leave
it.”</p>

<p>“In the mail!” I exclaimed, a great dawn rising in my
brain. “Wait a moment, Superintendent. I’ll tell you where
you found that paper!”</p>

<p>“Gumme, if you haven’t guessed it or something.”</p>

<p>“In the armoury!”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“In the armoury?” Crofts echoed dully, his brow scowling
down.</p>

<p>How clear the recollection was: the armoury in misty
bluish light, the three vague shapes of men, the one with the
white tuft and shirt-front picking the pockets of the other
two, the narrow face at the candle before the room was turned
to darkness. Unsuccessful that search must have been;
Cosgrove must have “posted” this letter afterward. But what
was Lord Ludlow’s part in this muddle? Surely he played
an extra hand, perhaps a lone hand. I looked at his guileless
countenance and would have given a guinea to know what was
going on behind it.</p>

<p>I shifted my attention to Salt again. “But there must have
been some disturbance, Superintendent. I don’t believe that
even you—”</p>

<p>“Cleanin’,” acknowledged Salt. “Miss Carmody—Jael, that
is—was dustin’ about. No question she shook it loose, for it
was lyin’ on the floor under the newer suit of armour when
I passed through at twelve o’clock.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see—why, the mail is—” commenced Mrs.
Bartholomew diffidently.</p>

<p>“The coat of mail, the coat of mail,” growled Bob Cullen.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Salt. “You see, Mr. Pendleton, you had
a little Post Office here after all. This note was tucked away
between the chain-mail and the cuirass. Couldn’t have been a
better hidin’-place, as long as there were no children in the
house to pick things to pieces.”</p>

<p>The ladies had passed from the room, and we were on the
point of following, when Salt recalled us with a casual remark.
“Well, I’m poppin’ off now, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Eh!” exclaimed Crofts. “I thought Dr. Niblett—”</p>

<p>“We’re off together, sir. The Coroner’s conductin’ the
bodies, and I’m conductin’ the Coroner.”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, send us some newspapers to read,” I
urged.</p>

<p>“I will, I will.” Salt cast his eye somewhat sardonically
about the circle. “Any more small commissions from any of
you gentlemen?”</p>

<p>We clustered at the doorway where the melancholy caravan
set out in charge of Dr. Niblett. The bodies of Cosgrove and
of the unknown, stitched in sheets and laid along improvised
stretchers, were to be carried by motor as far as the temporary
bridge, across which they must be borne by hand. The
undertaker’s van was waiting across the Water to convey them to
the mortuary, where to-morrow they will be “viewed” by the
Coroner’s juries impanelled to sit on the bodies.</p>

<p>They were gone.</p>

<h2>XVIII. <br> Grisly Planting</h2>

<p>With the departure of the dead men from the
House, the mansion seemed to me for the nonce most lonely.</p>

<p>I drifted away from the others, into the vacant Hall of
the Moth, slouched down in one of the flimsy chairs. My
mind was rather wistful for the deceased Cosgrove, wanting
him back, but not quite sure whether I preferred him to
return alive or dead.</p>

<p>Voices of persons passing in the armoury came to me.</p>

<p>Belvoir’s: “Why, Galton proved that long ago. It stands
to reason—”</p>

<p>Lib’s: “Shoot that man!”</p>

<p>A pause in the universe. Then the lightest sound of feet
tripping down the stairs, the flutter of a white skirt in the
corridor, and an apparition crossed the door. At unexpected
sight of me, the apparition became motionless in a pretty sort
of confusion, while I staggered to my modest height.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Bannerlee! I didn’t expect to find you here. That
horrid old man!”</p>

<p>“Why, er—good heavens, Miss Lebetwood, what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Blenkinson.”</p>

<p>“What, the Master of University College!”</p>

<p>“Why, no—”</p>

<p>“That’s only my ambition for him, you know. When the
post is vacant, I intend to put up his name for it. But what’s
the wretch done?”</p>

<p>“He scolded me!”</p>

<p>“The impudent—”</p>

<p>“Or he would have if he dared. That’s the same thing,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“But what, specifically?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I was coming out of Millicent’s room. She
was going to have a game with me this afternoon, but told
me she felt too tired after all.”</p>

<p>“With the last ball disposed of by Bob Cullen?”</p>

<p>“The last I’d let that precious pair have, that was. I had
sense to keep a few for myself. Well, I was awfully sorry
Millicent wasn’t up to it, and I would have gone back to my
own room and changed out of these clothes. But when I came
into the passage, Blenkinson was stepping along as large as
life and as still as a—as a cat. When he saw me he stopped
about six feet away and just let down his jaw and stared.”</p>

<p>“Very bad form.”</p>

<p>“I said, ‘What’s wrong, Blenkinson?’ pretty nippily, I guess,
and he gave a sort of groan and said, ‘They are taking Mr.
Cosgrove’s remains to the mortuary, Miss.’ I didn’t say
anything; so he groaned again.”</p>

<p>“Really, you mustn’t concern yourself with the foibles of a
foolish old servant. Anyone with an ounce of sense would know
you mean for the best.”</p>

<p>“<em>Mean</em> for the best!” The sweet grave eyes dimmed a
little. “I’m <em>doing</em> for the best! Each day since this happened
I’ve been alone for hours, thinking, thinking, thinking. I know
more about Sean than anyone else here, and I go over every
particle of knowledge I possess, to discover if it can have any
bearing on his death. Oh, I’ve thought so hard that my head
hurts—and emotions like this tear you up even if you’re too
busy thinking to pay attention to how you feel. Don’t you
see, Mr. Bannerlee, I mustn’t be a weeping-willow sort of
person; I’ve got to get some relief once in a while. I’ve got
to get the air into my lungs and the blood into my brain,
if I’m to do any good. I’m doing more for Sean by swinging
a racquet than I would if I bedewed his brow with tears.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, by George! Did you tell this to Blenkinson?”</p>

<p>“To that old woman!”</p>

<p>A silence came. I watched her; her eyes wandered restlessly
from object to object within the room. She turned
suddenly toward the window and looked at the glorious day,
and as quickly turned to me again. “Oh, this is too good to
be wasted! I must play. I’ve got to have someone to beat,
Mr. Bannerlee; may I beat you?”</p>

<p>The youth and verve of this girl, her strength of spirit, and
the unspoken appeal in her clear blue eyes, were almost too
much for me. There was a directness about her, like the
passage of an arrow to its mark, unusual in women, I believe,
when combined with such softness and allurement as is hers.
I had a very noble impulse to take that straight and slender
body in my arms, and to bestow a needful comfort of kisses
on lips and cheeks and on that cruel golden hair.</p>

<p>As with most such good impulses, this one changed into
something inferior: I bowed politely. “I’ll do my best,” I
said. “Give me ten minutes. I’ll borrow what I need from
Crofts, as usual.”</p>

<p>“Will you? Oh, thank you so much!” (To be thanked, so
earnestly, by a <i>dea certe</i>!) “I warn you, I’ll beat you. I hope
you can give me a battle.”</p>

<p>Such was my hope, too, when we stepped on the concrete
court a quarter of an hour later.</p>

<p>I should have been routed had I not been able to deliver
a smashing serve which landed in the proper court about one
time in three. These serves were almost always clean aces,
and after one of them I was startled to hear applause from
the little knoll which overlooked the court some distance away.
There was Lib.</p>

<p>“Hotto servo, old sportsman!” she called. “Glad there’s
somebody Paula’ll let play with her old tennis balls.”</p>

<p>It was due to happen sooner or later, of course, but it
was rather humiliating immediately afterward to have a wild
shot from my racquet fly many yards over the enclosure.</p>

<p>“Bravo,” called Miss Dale, and laughed and laughed. “Hotto
smasho!”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” I called, rushing across; “I’ll get it.”</p>

<p>“Try,” laughed the lonely spectator on the hill. “Serves
you right, Paula. The great big brute of a man!”</p>

<p>“I think it went into the stream,” said Miss Lebetwood.
“You’ll have to run.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll save it right enough; plenty of time to intercept
it,” I answered, turning my rush toward Aidenn Water,
which, owing to a convolution of its course, was some forty
yards above the end of the court and about twice that distance
from the side-line.</p>

<p>I kept a careful watch; no ball came down.</p>

<p>“It must be among the strawberry trees after all,” I said,
and we commenced a search through the planted grove which
had been so grateful to the dead Irishman, while Lib favoured
us with audible quips at our discomfiture.</p>

<p>“Just the same, I believe it went into the water,” said Miss
Lebetwood at the outset of our hunt.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure it didn’t,” I contradicted. “How could it
have? I got over there in plenty of time—”</p>

<p>“Well then, find it here.”</p>

<p>But the ball was not to be found.</p>

<p>We resumed the match. I served doubles.</p>

<p>“Don’t lose your nerve,” called Lib. “I’ve mortgaged my—say,
folks, there’s a rumpus up at the House. Jiminy, I’ll bet
something’s happened!”</p>

<p>Miss Lebetwood and I looked at each other.</p>

<p>“What is it, Libkins?” she asked sharply. “What do you
see?”</p>

<p>“Slews of people—millions of ’em—running around the
House. Say, there’s Doctor Aire going like a pump-handle.
Say, I’m going to see what this is.”</p>

<p>I looked at Miss Lebetwood, and we broke into a run,
following Lib.</p>

<p>Although we arrived almost the last of the crowd, Finlay,
the venerable gardener, was still positively drooling with
excitement. To him the credit must go for having inadvertently
put a term to more than one of our galling problems.</p>

<p>Crofts rather fancies carrying on old Watts’ custom of
experiment with unusual trees and shrubs. For the sake of
their jewel-like red berries, he had a couple of Guelder Rose
plants, almost full-grown, ready to be put in the soil, when
Cosgrove’s death set all things awry. To-day they could not
be kept out of the ground any longer. One of the small trees
was to be placed at the turn of the drive around the front
of the House, about fifty feet from the library tower.</p>

<p>At the appointed site Finlay had merrily tossed up the soil
from a considerable cavity while Miss Lebetwood and I played
our game. There had come a jab of the spade which appeared
to make the earth settle somewhat. Again the gardener pressed
the spade with his heel; the earth seemed to give way. Alarmed,
for he knew that there were no drains passing beneath this
lawn, Finlay got out of the pit he had digged, reached down
and poked experimentally with his tool. Of a sudden, the
bottom of the hole sank something like a yard, and a chunk
of antique subterranean masonry, broken off, was revealed,
with sluggish black water visible through the gap. But something
else was showing there, too, besides the mass of soil which
had fallen through the collapsed roof of the waterway:</p>

<p>A face, with lips, nose, eyelids, cheeks distended into a
simple green sphere—and a hand, its palm covered with thickened,
white, and sodden skin.</p>

<p>Sir Brooke Mortimer was found.</p>

<p>I was far too late, of course, to hear what had been said by
those first around the hole. I learned afterwards. Crofts
Pendleton, barring some natural repugnance to the body in process
of dissolution, had seemed to take a sullen joy in the
discovery.</p>

<p>“Here’s your murderer!” he had even cried.</p>

<p>“No, no! Never!” Eve Bartholomew murmured, gave a
slight shriek, and fainted dead away, to be carried by stalwart
persons into the Hall.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Belvoir.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” declared Miss Lebetwood, and challenged
Doctor Aire: “Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered; “he’s been dead at least as long as
Sean.”</p>

<p>The Guelder Rose plant, which must have a new hole dug
for it now, lay alongside the cavity with its branches bound
up and its root encased in a bag. Beside the rose lay the body
of the unfortunate Knight, drawn from the mysterious water-channel.
I should not have recognized it, had it been the corpse
of some friend of mine.</p>

<p>Mastering the disgust that welled in me, I bent over the
drawn face, with its nostrils dilated and eyes forced forward
from their sockets. The dead lips were parted and the
blackened tip of the tongue protruded between the teeth.</p>

<p>I arose, looked down into the eyes of the physician.
“Strangled?”</p>

<p>He shook his head slightly. “By water only. The tongue’s
a <i>post-mortem</i> result. Look at his fingers.”</p>

<p>The fingers of the huge hands resting across the chest were
covered with slime, save for two or three, the ends of which
appeared excoriated.</p>

<p>“He was drowned in this subterranean waterway. God
knows how he got in, but you can see that his fingers clutched
at the oozy walls and in some places must have pressed through
the slime to the stone itself. There’s a mark on his forehead,
too, not quite so easily accounted for. No connection with
cause of death, however.”</p>

<p>“This <em>is</em> Sir Brooke, of course?” I asked. “It might be
anyone, for all the humanity left in the lineaments.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it is from the description of the clothing alone,”
declared the Doctor, “but we can satisfy ourselves without
delay.”</p>

<p>He plucked the arms from across the chest, then unbuttoned
the coat. Across the waistcoat extended a black band affixed
to a pince-nez with double lenses. Aire held these up with a
significant look, then reached into the inside pocket and
withdrew the dead man’s wallet. This was conclusive, for inside
it was stamped the name in gilt: Crowell Brooke Mortimer.
But the flutter of voices that came was not for this discovery.</p>

<p>From between coat and waistcoat two objects had been
dislodged, objects which rolled out upon the lawn: a couple of
water-logged tennis balls.</p>

<p>I picked one up. The cloth was rotted, and slipped off with
a scrape of the finger. “Well,” I said, “now we know how
Sir Brooke lost his way.”</p>

<p class="diarydate">Same day. 9.55 <span class="meridienne">P.M.</span></p>

<p>In half an hour Salt was among us once more, and half
an hour later he had come upon the entrance to the underground
channel, an arch of stone masonry veiled by an overhanging
branch of alder and almost wholly submerged in the
stream. It lies, as we expected to find, at the part of Aidenn
Water nearest the tennis court, and a fair current sweeps
beneath it. This curious tunnel appears to extend several
hundred feet, and does not end where the Knight’s body was
found. The corpse had been detained by a partial stoppage
caused by the collapse of some of the masonry. But we have
not discovered where the channel rejoins the main stream.
If I am at all a judge of facial expressions, Salt is a
disappointed man. Evidently this gruesome factor casts some
elaborate equation of his out of all computation. It struck me at
dinner that Aire, too, looked a bit frustrated.</p>

<p>Talk in the Hall of the Moth after dinner was equally
divided between pity for Sir Brooke (and for Mrs. Bartholomew,
who was absent) and amazement at the lopped and disordered
accounts given of our mystery in the London papers
which Salt had brought with him as he had promised. I rather
enjoyed hearing Ludlow pitch into the gentlemen of the press,
for whom it is obvious he has no love—and for those for
whom he has no love he has no mercy.</p>

<p>Maryvale came up, and for once I did not feel uneasy at the
sight of him. He was smiling broadly, I thought a little too
broadly after what had occurred this afternoon. I recalled,
however, that Aire was now taking precautions to insulate
Maryvale from contact with any atrocities which may present
themselves—and then flashed through my mind almost the
very words which the man of business was about to say.</p>

<p>“You don’t think so cheaply of my warnings now, Mr.
Bannerlee. Now you must realize what was meant by the
spanning and roofing of the waters.”</p>

<p>“Fully.”</p>

<p>“No, sir!—not fully. There is much for you yet to know.
But all this agitation, this ebullition in the newspapers, this
official scrutiny, will lead to nothing.”</p>

<p>“You refer to what you told me this morning?”</p>

<p>“As I said, this man Cosgrove was removed because he stood
in my way and in the way of my art.”</p>

<p>I thrust in sharply. “Did you remove him yourself?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Maryvale, “but I have done worse deeds.”</p>

<p class="diarydate">3 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>I have heard a curious thing. A few minutes ago I woke
with a start and lay wondering what had roused me. Then
the cry of the cat throbbed from the upper Vale again. The
howl rose and fell endlessly, as it seemed, until, while it
mounted to a new pitch of despair, it broke off. There has not
been the faintest murmur since.</p>

<h2>XIX. <br> The Deathless Arm</h2>

<p class="diarydate">October 7. 11.15 <span class="meridienne">A.M.</span></p>

<p>A Spartan is among us.</p>

<p>Not only did Eve Bartholomew appear this morning at
breakfast at the early hour Salt had suggested, but she seemed
almost in brighter mood than before, and I can understand
how the discovery of Sir Brooke, for better or worse, may
have taken a burden from her mind. Still, she is brave, though
she spoke with a rather wan utterance, addressing me, who
had the fortune to consume porridge next her in the window.</p>

<p>“I had expected it,” she said. “Of course I never could have
hinted such a thing before, but I realized that sooner or
later such a man as Sir Brooke must fall foul of one of his
many enemies.”</p>

<p>I uttered some vague sound.</p>

<p>“Mark my words, Mr. Bannerlee, the villain will be brought
to vengeance for that blow! I understand how Miss Lebetwood
feels—why, Blenkinson, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“N‑nothing, Ma’am. I beg your pardon,” said the butler,
who had been fussily arranging the window-shade, and took
flight.</p>

<p>“What did he do?” I asked quickly.</p>

<p>“He made the most extraordinary grimace I have ever seen.
I hope the man is not subject to, er—anything.”</p>

<p>“I think not,” I answered drily, guessing well the cause of
the facial disturbance. “But you were saying, Mrs.
Bartholomew?”</p>

<p>“I have something that would do the poor man good. I
must speak to him later. Er, what <em>was</em> I saying?”</p>

<p>“That you understood how Miss Leb—”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed! I admire that young woman, and I intend
to follow her example. Until the murderer of Sir Brooke is
found, I shall not rest!”</p>

<p>But this was nothing to what was in store later. An hour
afterward Salt had us all in the conservatory, very much on
tenterhooks. When he had surveyed us with calm and taken
the roll mentally, he made a little speech.</p>

<p>“Since you’ll all be goin’ to New Aidenn for the inquest
this afternoon, I thought I might give you a few hints. The
fact is, we want as little as possible to come out. I have those
orders from higher up. The Coroner’s business is to ascertain
the cause of death, if he can; the rest is my business. I know
Dr. Niblett will play the game accordin’ to my rules, and he
won’t try to carry the question any deeper than that the
deceased came by his death by means of the stone that Mr.
Blenkinson luckily discovered. But there’s no tellin’ what
some busybody juryman or other may want to know; so I
want to warn you there’s one subject you must be shy of—that’s
this ‘King in Ireland’ topic. There’s enough hullabaloo
in the Emerald Isle right now without spreadin’ that.”</p>

<p>“Still,” said Alberta, “I don’t see how we are quite going
to tell whether a question will lead—”</p>

<p>“I’m comin’ to that, now. I’m goin’ to share some facts
with you. This that I’m tellin’ you is the result of special
information from Miss Lebetwood, Mrs. Bartholomew, and
Lord Ludlow, added to a few small discoveries of my own.
Now, remember, I want you to keep this budget of facts in
mind and not show by a word or a sign that you know anything
about it. That’s the only reason there is for this assembly.
Anybody behind that door, Mr. Pendleton?”</p>

<p>Crofts flung open the studded portal, revealing emptiness
in the corridor.</p>

<p>“Servants sometimes like to wait behind doors, just in case
anyone should ring for ’em,” observed Salt. “You might keep
an ear open in that direction, sir. Now, here’s the way of it.”</p>

<p>From what we heard in the next half-hour, what a change
comes over the picture of Sir Brooke! I had heard of him
as capricious, cantankerous, unsure-footed, gentle-hearted,
weak-eyed, sick: the image of ineptitude. Yet what was he but the
emissary of the powers behind the powers that be!—no fool
at all, but the super-confidential spokesman of an Office powerful
and discreet! I had heard of him as a guest like the others,
save that he was to “propose the bride’s health.” Now we
envisage him as coming to meet Cosgrove plenipotentially under
the guise of the Bidding Feast! There had been earlier
meetings here between these men. Indeed, while the revelation
increased in scope, I began to wonder if the whole idea of the
Feast was not shrewdly put upon Crofts by Cosgrove’s suggestion,
so that there might be an out-of-the-way corner for the
final tryst between the representatives of the United Kingdom
and of the Kingdom of Ireland about to be reborn.</p>

<p>“It may relieve Lord Ludlow’s mind,” said Salt, “if I clear
up his connection with the affair at once. That Bangor and
Newcastle address, sir,” he went on, looking at me, “seemed to
give you a turn the other day, but it was really rather
enlightenin’, you know.”</p>

<p>“I must be very stupid—”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it—only you should have studied your geography
just a little more thorough. So should I, for that matter;
I didn’t guess the connection either. You see, both those places
are in Ireland.”</p>

<p>“Ireland!” came several gasps as one.</p>

<p>“Fact. Two little towns near Belfast, nearer twenty than
thirty miles apart, I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p>“What goes on in those places?” asked Aire. “I’ve been in
Bangor, County Down. It has no industries to speak of.”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the main those are seasonable towns; both on the
coast, I believe. But Lord Ludlow and the other principals
have projected a tolerable business in the linen-weavin’ line to
give employment to every inhabitant the winter through; so
there’ll be flourishin’ manufactories in both a year or two
from now. And that properly explains Lord Ludlow’s interest:
day by day here he was tryin’ to find what was goin’ to happen
to his pet lamb.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what you were in a sweat about,” said Crofts,
turning to Ludlow. “Cosgrove wouldn’t have matured his
plans in a generation.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you’re sure to be wrong, sir,” contradicted
Salt. “The truth is, nobody except Sir Brooke could have had
an idea how near Cosgrove’s coup was to takin’ place. One or
two more parties to sound, a little time to work out the final
details and give the final orders—and the fat would have been
in the fire! Why, the papers say Ireland’s half-mad to-day as
it is.”</p>

<p>“Where do you come in?” asked Crofts belligerently, fixing
his eye on Oxford this time, and that well-nurtured gentleman
lost countenance, but Salt made answer.</p>

<p>“Mr. Oxford has been pretty close to Mr. Cosgrove all
along, as you’ll recall,” he said to our host. “He may have
excited Mr. Cosgrove once or twice, but that was in another
connection altogether.” Although guardedly, the Superintendent
gave a swift look toward Miss Lebetwood. I intercepted
it. “Another connection altogether. I think perhaps that it was
due to Mr. Oxford keepin’ such a good watch on Mr. Cosgrove
and his servant that Sir Brooke made up his mind to
come down here when he did and have the cards laid plain
on the table.”</p>

<p>“This servant, who was he?” put in the insatiable Crofts.
“Cosgrove never brought a servant to any house of mine
before.”</p>

<p>“He’s in the mortuary, too, now.”</p>

<p>“What, the gorilla-man!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was so. I comprehended many things in an instant, and
Salt’s re-enforcement of them came tumbling after. The
creature I had met near the top of Mynydd Tarw, who had dwelt
in the cleft of the hill, had been an Irishman, Cosgrove’s
servant. That was an Irish yell he had yelled plump in my
face, some adjuration to bid a demon begone, for he must have
taken me for a fiend of the mist when I fell in his path. The
unaccountable burned paper in Cosgrove’s grate was a
message from this man; he it was whom Cosgrove had intended
to smuggle into the House as an “extra progeny for the
elephant.”</p>

<p>I recollected our meeting, how he had seemed to be straining,
staggering, spent with haste, even before he had encountered
me and found a new cause for flight. The presumption
was strong that he had lately met with some alarming
experience. What could that have been? Had he seen the
black-bearded unknown, the menagerie-keeper? There was nothing in
that person’s colloquy with me to suggest it.</p>

<p>More likely the gorilla-man had run across Sir Brooke.
Still, in the mere encounter there could have been no cause
for terror; neither was anything to the other, and the Knight
was hardly a figure to inspire awe. What was more probable
than a meeting on the Water bank above the tennis court?
One man was skulking secretly; the other had lost his way.
Possibly there had been a collision, or perhaps the prowler had
only seen the shape of Sir Brooke taking form in the fog,
then suddenly falling in the Water at a fatal mis-step. That
abrupt fall, perhaps one choking cry, no more, before the
instant total disappearance of the body beneath the tunnel arch
(of which the gorilla-man could have no knowledge)—these
account sufficiently for the fear in Cosgrove’s servant,
spurring him hillward. This, I believe—and it is Salt’s belief as
well as mine—is the true story.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s not quite cricket to criticize Cosgrove, now
he’s gone,” said Crofts in an unusually reflective manner. “I
do think that he might have shot straighter, you know. I don’t
see what he was driving at when he brought this ruffianly
man of his down here in secret, to lurk about, perhaps to
thieve, and above all, to be brought among us in disguise that
evening. What was the point of that, I’d like to know!”</p>

<p>“No doubt about it,” declared Salt. “Mr. Cosgrove, havin’
no idea what had happened to Sir Brooke the night before,
expected him surely to be here by the time the Noah thing
commenced.”</p>

<p>“What’s that to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Cosgrove was particularly anxious to bring the
pair of ’em together, I expect.”</p>

<p>Crofts looked at Salt as at one suddenly seized with
dementia. “To bring them together? Why should he want to
do that?”</p>

<p>“To show he meant business, Mr. Pendleton.”</p>

<p>Aire asked quickly, “Who was this wild man?”</p>

<p>“Ah, I was wonderin’ who’d ask me,” said Salt. “Please
don’t mention it, ladies and gentlemen, but the man killed by
the landslide was sure to be Toban First, the royal King of
Ireland!”</p>

<p class="diarydate">Same day. 10.10 <span class="meridienne">P.M.</span></p>

<p>A couple of snubbed and highly aggrieved juries brought
in verdicts of “Wilful Murder” and “Misadventure” respectively,
as they were told to, and within half an hour of my
entering the mortuary, I was in the street again. For a few
minutes I was busy resisting the minions of the press, who
buzzed about all of us but secured small plenishments of
honey. I surmise that the likelihood of exposure to blandishing
newsgatherers was the principal reason why Blenkinson, finder
of the stone, was the only servant brought from the Vale to
give testimony.</p>

<p>Alberta suggested that instead of returning to the House
immediately the party should spend the afternoon in motors.
Everyone gladly acceded to this means of relief from the
oppressive atmosphere of the Vale; everyone, that is, save Aire,
who, having given his evidence in the second inquest, had
withdrawn to prepare for the third, which will be held in a day
or so. At the last moment, since we made too large a crowd
to be packed loosely into the pair of available cars, I, too,
seceded from the group, alleging quite truly that since the
afternoon was fine, tramping and exploring would do me
perfectly.</p>

<p>Time-wracked New Aidenn lies in the shadow of its huge
castle mound whose fortress no longer stands atop, and the
vestiges of old city walls are far out in the fields where the
cows find succulent grazing. In ordinary circumstances these
vestiges of greatness and evidences of decay would have
kindled my ardour in the antiquarian way, but now I was
resolved upon two queerer visits.</p>

<p>I found Aire with Sir Brooke in a side chamber of the
mortuary itself. There was a faint scent of balsam in the room,
which was fitted with some of the appurtenances of a laboratory,
and Aire, in a white smock, had a slip of glass and a
pipette in his hand. Sir Brooke lay on a table at the far end of
the room, mercifully covered with a sheet.</p>

<p>“Ceremonies over?”</p>

<p>“They are, and no one the wiser. Your duties finished?”</p>

<p>“Oh, this isn’t duty, exactly. I could shunt it if I wished.
Only chance, you know, has made me the responsible medical
witness in all three deaths; so I have assumed the mantle of
whoever corresponds to a divisional police surgeon in the
country. I’m well paid—curiosity, and all that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, has curiosity received any communicable reward?”</p>

<p>“Prophecy fulfilled, at any rate. As I said, this man was
drowned—drowned and nothing else.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t you say something about a bruise on the
forehead? Mrs. Bartholomew won’t give you peace until that’s
explained.”</p>

<p>“No, I mentioned a mark, not a bruise. Peculiar thing, you
know—no contusion, just scraping and scratching of the skin
above the left eye. In itself nothing unusual, but there was
a long wood splinter stuck there; that’s the oddest feature
of the death.”</p>

<p>“What’s it like?”</p>

<p>Aire took from a rack on the wall an envelope, and from
it extracted a thin fragment, about an inch long, dark brown
in colour, and feeling like rock.</p>

<p>“Why, this isn’t—”</p>

<p>“It requires microscopy to show that it’s wood at all.”</p>

<p>“I’d never believe it, surely.”</p>

<p>“It’s almost petrified. That happens, extremely rarely, when
certain kinds of wood are immersed in running water for long
periods. The organic substance is replaced by precipitated
mineral matter.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t strike me as being of such vast importance.”</p>

<p>“One wonders, for instance, what’s kept it submerged and
stationary.”</p>

<p>At the door of departure I laughed. “A question indeed. But
I must be off.”</p>

<p>“Sounds as if you had plans for the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I have. I am going to take a walk—Belvoir’s hint, you
remember.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say I do.”</p>

<p>“A walk into the past. By the way, you had a letter this
morning. May I ask if it was in reference to the blood-test?”</p>

<p>“It was, indeed. And pig’s blood you found that night for
a certainty. The test reaction of the blood I sent with
anti-human sera was negative.”</p>

<p>“There’s some comfort in that, but it leaves the problem no
less vexed than before.”</p>

<p>“More vexed, if you ask me. If it had been the vital fluid
of a man, we’d have some notion of what we’re looking for.
As it is, even the nature of the problem is vague.”</p>

<p>“Cannibal,” I said. “Well, I must be going; these roads
are new to me. When I return to New Aidenn, I expect a bit
of interesting mail myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve sent for my copy of the Book of Sylvan Armitage—not
that the missing portion of the manuscript is in it. I’ve
thumbed the volume too much to have overlooked anything of
that sort. Well, cheerio.”</p>

<p>“Cheerio.” Aire returned to his far from cheery work while
I set my footsteps out of town and eastward.</p>

<p>On every side around the graceful slopes of hills intercepted
one another in a little-changing prospect while I trod the
highway across green Radnor Plain. I passed the prehistoric Four
Stones in their black-grey stoicism, passed Doomsday parks,
passed old cottages with slate-shingled roofs. Above an avenue
of oaks the square tower of St. Stephen’s in Old Aidenn had
been gradually mounting the sky ahead of me, and in due time I
diverged from the road and climbed the oak avenue to the
village.</p>

<p>What would I find beneath that Norman tower? Hints
of symbolic meanings of the “deathless arm” were rife in mind.
Are the descendants of Sir Pharamond Kay living yet?
Perhaps—and the suggestion caused me to bate my breath—one of
us guests in Highglen House actually belongs to the family
of Kay. This supposition had not occurred to me before as a
live idea. Now it had force. It was, too, an hypothesis that
offered scope and direction for investigating, and in a subject
where I was more or less at home. Perhaps (a big perhaps) I
might play a large part yet in the untwining of these twisted
skeins.</p>

<p>I will not say that I was growing excited while I procured
the church key from its custodian in one of the handful of
straggling houses remaining of the mediæval town: I had,
in fact, been excited and eager all during my walk across the
monotonous plain. I entered the churchyard by the lych-gate;
the place was overcrowded with crumbling stones among the
red-barked yews. The men and women with shears, who
trimmed the grass along the graves of dear ones, looked at me,
I thought, with more than ordinary interest; there must have
been marks of eagerness in my face. I unlocked the wire-screen
outer door, found the portal within the vestibule
unfastened, and entered the little church.</p>

<p>The empty air smelled sweet and sanctified. The hour was
clouded, and I wished that some of the oil lamps hanging from
the low roof might be lit, for the interior was rather cavernous
in the absence of sun. Searching, I seemed fated to encounter
everything but the thing I sought. These were features with a
reputation: the rood screen of fan tracery and leaf-flower-and-grape
carvings, that unique organ-case dating back to the
Gothic period, the window of St. Catherine’s Wheel—but I
spent not a second apiece on them, looking with greater
interest at the tombstones in the floor, at the memorial tablets
between the windows, and at the ’scutcheons painted on the
wall with colours still bright.</p>

<p>A flash of lightning drove the darkness from even the
remotest corners of the church, and my heart gave a leap. That
instant I had seen a long, bulky object in a recess of the chapel
on my left.</p>

<p>It was the tomb of Sir Pharamond, stained and gnawed by
centuries. The effigies of the lord of Aidenn and his lady rested
there in stone, with small beasts recumbent at their feet. I lit
a match to examine the face and figure of the man. The crown
of the head was clean gone, and a fragment of the chin had
fallen away, but it was impossible not to recognize the sharp,
malignant features, the keen lips, the close-set eyes as being those
of the paintings in Highglen House.</p>

<p>The left arm of the effigy lay across the breast, the mailed
fist clasping a broken sword. The right arm was missing.</p>

<p>At first I thought that, like the pieces of the head, it had been
a prey to time, but careful examination by the light of a second
match proved the carving to be complete: the chain mail ended
neat at the shoulder. No right arm had ever been there.</p>

<p>In haste I stooped and lit a third match to read what might
be decipherable of the inscription, but another lightning flash
disclosed the words still distinct on the side of the tomb, and I
read while it thundered:</p>

<blockquote class="inscription">

  <p>Let Trecchours be Ware   My Right Arme Shall Not
  Dye For soo I have Ordeyned</p>

</blockquote>

<p>These were all the words upon the monument.</p>

<h2>XX. <br> The Recrudescence of Parson Lolly</h2>

<p>I chanced upon an alternative road, with more
variety in its prospects, to take me back to the mouth of the
Vale, omitting New Aidenn entirely and saving a third of my
journey. Even on this short-cut southward, I found daylight
part drawn into evening when I reached the top of the vast hill
called the Smatcher, shaped like a loaf of bread, and began to
descend through its larches to the entrance of the Vale. Gleams
of sun walked from peak to peak while violet dusk deepened
along the skirts of the hills. On the highway below me I
perceived a human figure trudging toward the branch road to the
House.</p>

<p>I straightway recognized that sawed-off, machine-like form,
and the peculiar drawing-up of the shoulder with each step.
Doctor Aire was preceding me through the twilight.</p>

<p>I hailed him and joined him. “I thought the others might
pick you up.”</p>

<p>“Not returned yet, I dare say. Didn’t call for me, at any
rate. So I’m getting my fortnightly exercise.” He looked up
at me quizzically. “You found everything satisfactory?”</p>

<p>“Damnably the reverse. Why, there never was a right arm
on that effigy. Do you know, Doctor, I believe Maryvale has
the mission in life of plaguing me!”</p>

<p>“Not you alone, let me assure you. Other persons are agog
over his cryptic remarks. I, for instance.”</p>

<p>“You? Oh, no.”</p>

<p>“Yes. You didn’t hear what he told the Pendletons and me
this morning at breakfast? He said that Parson Lolly is
dead.”</p>

<p>“Parson Lolly dead! That was fudge.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, he assured us with perfect gravity that
the Parson died last night.”</p>

<p>“He was pulling your leg.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. I know Maryvale that well, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Give it your own name, then; I’d call it empty talk.”</p>

<p>Aire twitched around at me in a surprised way. “Never,”
he declared. “Sure, Bannerlee, you must realize by this time
that there’s always something behind what Maryvale says. He
doesn’t merely vaporize.”</p>

<p>We were approaching the temporary bridge. “I wish you’d
tell me exactly what you think of Maryvale, Doctor. I confess
that to me there’s something uncanny about the man. If he’s
mad, he ought not to be loose among us, and if not—”</p>

<p>“If not?” Aire cocked his head to hear.</p>

<p>“—if not, he’s up to some subtle game.”</p>

<p>“Oho, you think so?”</p>

<p>“What else, for heaven’s sake?”</p>

<p>He waited to cross the bridge before he answered. “No, that’s
not my reading of Maryvale. I look on him as a man wrestling
with an idea, the idea of Parson Lolly.”</p>

<p>“And still I don’t get hold of your meaning.”</p>

<p>“It’s this way. Gilbert Maryvale has come to Aidenn Vale
before. Each time, certainly, a tradition of the countryside, a
popular half-belief, has been mentioned, more often discussed
with some fullness. It is, to say the minimum, a fable of much
piquancy, a legend above the average in interest, this tradition
of the goblin-parson—is it not?”</p>

<p>“Granted, granted.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you often wished that fairy-tales were true? Maryvale
has almost convinced himself to believe in Parson Lolly.
His mind hasn’t conquered the idea, seems to be more or less
at the mercy of it. But sometimes he rebels. Now and then he
can see the absurdity as well as you or I; he can even laugh at
the Parson. But again he will fall into perplexity, confusion,
shame, fear over the idea. And he is capable, under suggestion
or after shock, of getting into the throes, quite possessed with the
reality of the unreal, virtually a maniac if you like that word.
At these times he makes the supreme surrender one is capable
of making to ideas.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Why, he <em>acts</em> on them. Remember his carrying that revolver
up the Vale.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I remember well enough.” We went on in silence a
little way, and then I said quickly, “But that doesn’t explain
everything. Madmen are consistent; that’s why they’re mad.
But Maryvale tells me that someone of the house of Kay did
this murder, and sends me over to Old Aidenn to find out about
that missing arm, and—”</p>

<p>“Of course he is not consistent; that’s why he is <em>not</em> mad,
as you persist in thinking. He is very much mixed, but his ideas
don’t fit into a complete system. I shall be sorry when they do,
and I think the sooner he leaves the Vale the better.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you suggest it?”</p>

<p>“I have, to Salt. However, the Superintendent doesn’t want
our group to be dissolved for a few days yet. I’d have Maryvale
out of here in a jiffy, though, if I felt his mental condition
were critical, not simply fluctuating, for there’s not the remotest
possibility of his being implicated in Cosgrove’s death.”</p>

<p>“Let me see, where was he, just?”</p>

<p>“Sitting with me on the steps of the summer-house the whole
time during which the murder could have happened. But if he
is shielded from any further mental concussion, I suppose there’s
no harm in his staying on here a while longer. Besides, you
know, he will have it that the Parson is dead.”</p>

<p>In the thickening gloom I could make out no expression on
the face of the man keeping step beside me. I spoke cautiously.</p>

<p>“I take it, then, Doctor, that you don’t think Maryvale may
have a hand in the manifestations of the Parson?”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Rather not! How could he?”</p>

<p>“I wish I could tell you. But in any case I suppose—I devoutly
hope, anyhow—that the manifestations are over, and the
explanations will be in order henceforth.”</p>

<p>“I second you willingly.”</p>

<p>We went on. I stumbled against a stone in the roadway.
“Doctor, you’ve heard about the man I encountered the night
I came here; I mean the one with the umbrella.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Salt asked my opinion about that chap.”</p>

<p>“What opinion could you have?”</p>

<p>“Question of sanity again.”</p>

<p>“What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Hopelessly sane, I should say. You didn’t take him for
crazed, did you?”</p>

<p>“No; I suppose his talk was fabricated.”</p>

<p>“From Salt’s account, I judged it was—most of it,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Which part do you exempt?”</p>

<p>“Well, wasn’t there an urgent warning about calling off
the dogs, and a reference to golden-haired woman? Believe me,
Bannerlee, this Mac-whatever-his-name-was meant what he
said just then.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But what I wanted to tell you, Doctor, was that
I can’t help connecting Maryvale with that man. The physical
differences in their appearance aren’t so great that they couldn’t
be one and the same, what with a false beard stuck on crooked,
and the rest of it. It’s unlikely, of course, but still—”</p>

<p>“Tut! it’s impossible.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know. You weren’t here that night.”</p>

<p>“Trust Salt. He has ascertained beyond a shade of doubt that
Maryvale and the rest of the party were in the House the
whole evening. The only possibility is that one of the
servants <em>might</em> have gone out looking that way, and you know how
likely that is.”</p>

<p>I gave a shrug to dismiss the whole question as insoluble.
“I thank my stars I wasn’t born a detective.”</p>

<p>“Curious how dark the House is,” said Aire. “So close to
dinner, too.”</p>

<p>The building had been in sight for a time, but only as a
black beast crouching with closed eyes on the lawn. Now we
were some hundred yards or so distant, but had still to go
through the gate-house archway if we followed the westward
trend of the drive.</p>

<p>I said, “I suppose our friends haven’t appeared. I’d make
my outing as long as possible, too, having to return at last to
this devil’s playground.”</p>

<p>We passed underneath the arch, crossed the lawn.</p>

<p>“Even the kitchens looked dark from down below. Can’t tell
about them from this side, though. I certainly expected the
motorists to be back by this time; didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“It looks like a tomb.”</p>

<p>I was aware that Aire had made a swift movement; then
I saw him stock still, with his hand part way to his lips in a
gesture of surprise.</p>

<p>“No lights, no. But there’s someone in the conservatory.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“I saw the gleam of a face at the window of the tower. Just
a white blotch. See that?”</p>

<p>“Right‑o.”</p>

<p>We made across the lawn at a run, entered the Hall of the
Moth by the unfastened french window, and encountered two
figures emerging from the conservatory.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you’ve come!”</p>

<p>“Miss Lebetwood!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s Millicent and I. Don’t—don’t be afraid,” she added
with a little, unsteady laugh.</p>

<p>“Are you alone? Is there something the matter with the
lights?”</p>

<p>“The lights are all right. Yes, we’re alone.”</p>

<p>Aire demanded, “Aren’t the servants here?”</p>

<p>“They’re all here, I guess. I meant our people, you know.
They brought us to the bridge, so we could come up and have
an hour or two of rest before dinner. They didn’t want to
come in yet; so they drove on again.”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you switch on the lights?” Aire queried.
“With all deference to your courage, I should think you would
have felt easier in your minds—”</p>

<p>“We didn’t dare turn on the light,” said Miss Lebetwood.</p>

<p>Aire and I barked astonishment.</p>

<p>Miss Mertoun, who had been clinging to the American
girl’s arm, said, “Do go on, Paula. Tell them what we
saw.”</p>

<p>“It’s very little after all,” said Miss Lebetwood. “We had
driven down to the Wye Valley, had tea, and come back again
by five-thirty, and someone suggested going north to Ludlow
before returning to the House. But Millicent and I said we’d
rather be excused; so one car waited on the main road while
the other brought us up and dropped us at the bridge. We
walked very slowly, and it wasn’t until about half an hour
ago that we reached the House. It was pretty dark, you know,
even then, but light from one or two kitchen windows showed
in the garden; so we weren’t scared at all.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” remarked Aire. “You didn’t come by the drive, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it was too dull for us. We came round through
the grove under Whimble and across the lawn south of the
House to the cat-head door. The door wasn’t latched, and we
simply walked into the vestibule, and we would have gone
straight upstairs, but Millicent remembered a book she had
left in the Hall of the Moth. So she went in there to get it,
and I waited by the steps, but a moment later I heard her give
a small scream. I ran in—”</p>

<p>“What had you seen, Miss Mertoun?” asked Aire, turning
to the English girl.</p>

<p>“Something looked in the window. Paula saw it, too.”</p>

<p>“ ‘Something’ is a trifle vague, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“But we don’t know what it was.”</p>

<p>“Well, what was its shape, and how was it dressed?”</p>

<p>“It was as tall as a man, maybe taller,” said Miss Lebetwood,
“and it was wrapped in a long black robe from the top of
its—head to the ground.”</p>

<p>“That’s the creature Oxford and I saw on the lawn that
first night,” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>Aire asked, “What was its face like?”</p>

<p>Miss Lebetwood spoke in a matter-of-fact tone. “It didn’t
have any face.”</p>

<p>Aire actually staggered back a step, and I reached out for
something to support me, but encountering nothing, concluded
to stand upright.</p>

<p>I found my voice. “You mean you couldn’t see any.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I was quite near the window—that one
by the armoury door. Millicent had left her book on the
cabinet there, and had reached the place before she saw the
shape, and I naturally went to her side. We had all the light
there was, and would have seen a face if there had been any
there.”</p>

<p>Stricken by a memory, I put my hand on Aire’s arm.
“Remember, Doctor, how Maryvale put no face in his
portrait?”</p>

<p>He ignored me, and said, “What then?”</p>

<p>“We were petrified, of course. It seemed to peer in, if you
can understand, even without a face. The whole attitude of
the thing was inquiring, curious. And then perhaps it saw us,
for suddenly it twisted and hurried away.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you get the servants?” I put in.</p>

<p>“Things were bad enough without that.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Bannerlee?”</p>

<p>“Go after it, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Right. You have a torch, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ll fetch it. You stay here to guard the
womenfolk.”</p>

<p>I made dizzy haste up the spiral stairs and down again, and
found the three outside the french window where the intruder
had stood. Aire was lighting matches in search of footprints,
but as had been predicted, vainly. We agreed that it would be
best for the two girls to return to the conservatory and keep
watch through the windows, having care to remain invisible.
If anything untoward happened, they were to signal us by
switching on the light, at the same time ringing for the
servants if danger was evident.</p>

<p>Aire and I went side by side over the lawn toward the small
solitary copse. First one of us flashed the light along the sward
while the other tried to penetrate the darkness ahead; then we
reversed duties. As for footprints, if there were any they were
exceedingly light and vague, and singularly small, but we
could not even agree there was a definite trail.</p>

<p>The distance from the House to the cypresses was over
two hundred feet, and before we had covered the distance the
Vale was filled with a soft illumination, as if twilight had
re-begun. On our right, the moon was rising over Whimble, a
crescent moon glowing like white-hot metal. Then Aire, who
had been looking ahead, drew up.</p>

<p>“Something’s among the trees for sure.”</p>

<p>While he spoke I saw movement underneath the horizontal
branches, and that queer, black-robed, conic figure—unmistakably
the same I had seen on the evening of my arrival—swiftened
from the shelter of the cypresses toward the
expansive darkness of the park where the summer-house stood.
The long loose-flying sleeves flapped curiously as if there were
no arms within them. The wide garment spread along the
ground, but we had no sight of legs or feet, and I admit I
felt uneasy at the thought that if we caught this unknown, it
might prove to have no face.</p>

<p>We ran in pursuit, but I was careful not to outstrip Aire,
lest the thing should turn and fell us separately. In
consequence, we barely maintained our distance, and had the
mortification of seeing the black robe merge with the night
among the sycamores of the park.</p>

<p>“Hear that?”</p>

<p>“It’s jumped into the stream.”</p>

<p>“Or fallen in.”</p>

<p>A little way within the park we found the steep-sided channel
of the brook which flowed across the farm of the sisters
Delambre, later on passed beneath the elaborated bridge, and
eventually joined Aidenn Water. The bank at this point was
five or six feet high.</p>

<p>“What next?”</p>

<p>Aire slid and floundered down to the edge of the rivulet
which whispered along the channel.</p>

<p>“Can’t tell for certain, but I believe it went toward the
bridge.”</p>

<p>I got down beside him, and we sped between the banks, which
gradually lifted above us. Dry land was scarce, and we did a
deal of splashing in the brook, but by the aid of my torch I
seemed to see ahead muddy traces of other splashing before
ours. A wild rose growing on the edge of the water had been
trampled down.</p>

<p>A couple of short turns in the course of the brook brought us
to the stone bridge, a structure magnificently heavy in the
body, but leaving a semicircular arch only about eighteen inches
high for the passage of water.</p>

<p>“It’s a blind alley. No man—or woman—could have gone
through there. There isn’t room for a good-sized dog.”</p>

<p>I bent down and shot the light underneath; there was
nothing but water there.</p>

<p>“Well—”</p>

<p>“Up the bank, did it go?”</p>

<p>I flashed the torch up and down both sides of us. On the
one hand was a miniature precipice more than ten feet high,
on the other was a wall of earth nearly vertical, thickly grown
with ivy-leaved toad-flax showing no sign that anything larger
than a mite had travelled over it.</p>

<p>“I never—” Aire began.</p>

<p>I could not repress a tremor when he suddenly looked skyward,
showing that the spell of magic could exist in his bones.
I turned my gaze up, too, as if I really expected to see a
black-robed figure floating over the ruined summer-house or receding
into the depths of the night sky. But it was eastward that Aire
was looking, and while we stared, some solitary winged form
flapped across the narrow surface of the moon.</p>

<p>“We’re beaten,” said Aire.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of here. I need a tonic.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go back?”</p>

<p>“No; I’ll give you a leg up, and you reach down a hand
to me.”</p>

<p>In this wise we crawled up the toad-flax, and a minute later
our wet feet were taking us back toward the cypress grove
again. I kept my light running along the ground, though my
hope was feeble of discovering any traces of the unknown. But
when we had reached the grove itself, Aire darted forward
with a chortling cry.</p>

<p>No need to tell me what the white thing was that he picked
up and held in a trembling hand. He tried to decipher it in the
moonlight before my torch made the letters clear:</p>

<blockquote class="placard">

  <p>LoOk OUT FoR mE ToNIGhT  PARSON LOLLY</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There was singularly little reaction on the part of anyone;
I think most of the minds in the House are drugged with
dangers and alarums.</p>

<p>“But, I say,” protested Charlton Oxford. “The beastly
placard says to-night, y’know.”</p>

<p>“Can you use a pistol?” asked Crofts.</p>

<p>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p>“You can have mine, then. As for me, I’m going to sleep
with one ear and one eye open, and shan’t be surprised at
anything, including being murdered.”</p>

<p>Alberta rang for someone to remove the coffee-cups. “And
nobody must whisper a word of it to the servants, must they,
Crofts?”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>Blenkinson himself entered, slipped about the room with
deferential soft-footedness, collected the débris, and carried
it out on two trays. I noticed his eyes once or twice sliding
into their corners while he stole an inscrutable look at Miss
Lebetwood.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary staff of servants you have,” remarked Aire,
as soon as the butler had departed.</p>

<p>“I’m paying double wages,” said Crofts shortly.</p>

<p>“I agree with Stephen,” declared Belvoir. “And I don’t
think wages alone cut much figure.”</p>

<p>“Tell them, Crofts,” said Alberta.</p>

<p>Her husband looked a bit abashed, but having encountered
the steady beam of her eye, growled, “Blenkinson.”</p>

<p>“Elucidate,” I said.</p>

<p>“Blest if I know,” confessed Crofts. “But there’s the fact.
The fellow’s a perfect lord among the community, and somehow
he’s induced the lot to believe that he’s able to protect
’em. I don’t know his method. He just assured me I could
depend on him.”</p>

<p>Silence fell, in which the clock was audible, and I noticed
that it was a quarter to ten.</p>

<p>Alberta yawned and made a gesture of weariness. “What do
you say to ten o’clock bed, people?”</p>

<p>Assent was unanimous.</p>

<hr>

<p>Those gate-house towers that nod to me across the lawn—may
they harbour the Parson? Those locked cellars that no
one has seen for years. Who or what may not be down there?
There are persons unaccounted for in the Vale. And where now
is the drowning-pit? In olden days this castle must have had
one. Discovering it, would I know more about the Parson, or
about the perfidious tree, or about the cat’s claw?</p>

<p>Some of these questions I may be able to answer, if—</p>

<p>Yes, just now, at eleven minutes to twelve, I tossed a sixpence
to decide. It fell spinning on the table, wobbled
provokingly, and said, “Go forth.”</p>

<p>Let the Parson beware! If I catch him—or her—to-night!</p>

<p class="diarydate">Five minutes to twelve.</p>

<p>Great God, through my open window—</p>

<p>Some woman’s voice, very faint. . . . I am not sure whose.
It is not Paula Lebetwood’s.</p>

<p>It called “Sean, poor Sean!” many times, and died away.</p>

<h2>XXI. <br> The Midnight Expedition</h2>

<p class="diarydate">October 8. 11 <span class="meridienne">A.M.</span></p>

<p>Furtively, yet with a strange half-fearful
pleasure, I made my way in safety to the top of the stairs and
down. I knew it was useless to inspect the rooms which had
been examined many times by day during the past week. So I
would have passed the library entrance without a moment’s
check in my rapid movement, had not a streak of light shot
forth from beneath the door just as I reached the bottom stair.
Someone had lit the chandelier.</p>

<p>I felt shock. I curdled. To investigate is one thing; to run
point-blank on revelations in the wrong place is another. I
had a panicky impulse to slip upstairs again and lock myself
in. But instead I loitered where I stood, staring at the yellow
drugget spread from the lintel.</p>

<p>The door was slightly ajar, and I saw a portion of the
panelling of the library wall; yet no sound came from within. A
pale screen of light, of which the edge drew a line on the
opposite side of the corridor, indicated that I might peep into
the room through the slit of the door. And though my curiosity
had somehow turned sick within me, presently I found myself
with my eye at the crack.</p>

<p>My legs seemed to wilt. If it had been Cosgrove himself,
burly as life, I could not have had a worse turn. A trim
young fellow, clad in dinner clothes and wearing a black cap,
was inside, and he was a stranger!</p>

<p>He had been standing beyond the table, apparently in thought,
his head three-quarters from me, so that I caught only the remote
profile of his smooth face, and a narrow slice of his white
shirt-front. But now he moved across the room to a bookcase
just within my triangle of vision, drew open its glass doors,
and commenced looking for some volume. He stood in full
view with his back toward me, turning his head from side to
side in a survey of the upper shelves. I could see then that
though slight of stature, he was, for his height, no mere skeleton,
but of fairly solid build, being even a bit broader across
the hips than at the shoulders.</p>

<p>A minute later he was beneath the light, his chosen volume
lay open before him. I recognized it instantly as the Book of
Sylvan Armitage. With his face cast into shadow by the peak
of his cap, he leaned across the table with one hand flat on the
red velvet, while the other ran through the pages. I could tell
that the outspread hand was delicate and tapering, an “artistic”
hand; but what I wanted to see plainly was that clean-shaved
face.</p>

<p>Of a sudden he picked the book up from the table, pushed
himself erect from his leaning position, walked toward the
armoury door and beyond my range of vision. There was a
click, and the chandelier faded out; a moment later I heard a
tiny jingling sound, as of curtain rings disturbed. The young
man was restoring the portières to their original places.
Then—nothing.</p>

<p>The debonair manner I discerned in this youth even during
observation so brief and cramped, the easy, natural way in
which his dapper feet carried him across the floor, as if the
place belonged to him—all so much at variance with the stealthy
habits of a lawless intruder—rather increased the numb,
foreboding ill-ease I felt.</p>

<p>At last I ventured into the library, and found it, as I
expected, in moon-bathed vacancy. The armoury and the Hall of
the Moth were also empty save for their furnishings. I stood
in the midst of the Hall, wondering where the young chap had
betaken himself, whether out of doors, which seemed unlikely,
whether into some crypt or cove in the massive walls, which
seemed unlikely, too, or into thin air, which, in spite of the
compulsion of ancient sorceries, seemed less likely than either.
Anyhow, he was gone, and it remained for me to consider what
course to take.</p>

<p>No need to retail my devious thoughts. In the end I saw no
good in rousing the house, particularly since I must reveal my
secret projects. I went on as before, with caution redoubled.</p>

<p>The corridor—no one there, apparently. The dinner-room—no
one there for certain. The kitchen—now I was in unknown
territory. I waited, listened, breathless. Only the whistle of a
bat outside, the creak of a timber within. I ran the shifting
circle of my torch about the walls, across the floor. A cockroach,
devil’s coachman, fled across the flags, and a great moth
with eyes glimmering green fluttered toward me from some
corner. There on its pillar hung the gate-house key; there,
beside the chimney-place where a modern stove presided, was
the door I sought.</p>

<p>With prodigious care I passed through this portal, for besides
leading ultimately to the bowels of the earth, it ushered
me at first into a passage off which opened the precincts of the
servants. These half-subterranean chambers lay beneath the
dinner-room and conservatory. While I stole past the doors, I
had audible evidence a-plenty that the dwellers within were
sleeping soundly enough.</p>

<p>This passage I was traversing had a distinct downward
tendency and stretched underneath the corridor of the ground
floor. It terminated in a door which, when I passed my light
over it, appeared very black and cumbrous. The key was in the
lock.</p>

<p>To my surprise, when by a series of graded pressures I
commenced to turn this key, it moved easy and soundless, as if
very recently oiled. Beyond was a winding stone stair.</p>

<p>By way of sensible precaution I removed the key and brought
it with me, having no wish to be immured in the depths for
any cause whatsoever. The stairs, a dozen or so in number,
brought me to the entrance of another passage beneath the first,
leading me in exactly the opposite direction. While it proceeded
it widened into a goodly cellar, and I made out the yawning
mouths of bins on either side, a comforting sight. There were
dark archways leading to other caverns. And when I stamped,
an unmistakable hollow sound came from below, proof that
some buried chamber existed there.</p>

<p>The trap-doors by which one gained these sub-cellars, Crofts
had said, were long disused, inch-deep in dust. And a few
seconds later I came upon one of them, a heavy iron plate in the
floor, clamped down with a clumsy padlock—but the dust was
cleared away, and the padlock was not fastened at all! I
picked the thing up from where it was lying by the flange, and
stared at it stupidly. It would never lock anything again; it
had been forced.</p>

<p>Now, surely, this was none of Salt’s work; he had promised
to do no more than inspect the dust-covered entrances. It
became increasingly evident that someone had preceded me in this
search, someone careful not to be detected while he came, but
careless whether it was known that he had been. God forbid
that he was still below!</p>

<p>With one fierce tug I lifted the door by a ring in the centre;
it fell backward with a heavy clang, and an atmosphere of
choking damp came up from the hole it left.</p>

<p>A stair descended therein, very steep and narrow, with a
thinnish fuzzy coating which must have been dust, though
where it came from would have been difficult to tell. In the dust
there were footprints, big footprints.</p>

<p>I didn’t like it, but I went on down. The rough stone walls
were crumbling with water-rot and the sheer decay of age.
While the air grew more smothering, I ran my head into
stalactitic cobwebs and rubbed elbows with evil fungi sprouting in
every crevice.</p>

<p>It seemed as if there must be a hundred of those steps, though
actually they were about the same number as had been in the
winding stair. At length I saw that I had come to the last of
them, for the big footsteps tramped across a lumpy floor,
athwart the glistening path of a snail. The door was earth,
soggy and covered with that same thin dust-layer.</p>

<p>Midnight was midnight there indeed. Without my torch,
I should never have returned a sane man. Nor did my light,
dancing about from wall to wall, make it endurable. Fungi
grew riotously everywhere, and the cobwebs, black as a funeral,
hung down thick from the vaulted ceiling, like infamous hair.
One or two spiders darted out and scurried immediately back
into their loathsome jungle. Whenever I shifted my light, I
had a feeling that from the place left in darkness the vile growth
was reaching out tentacles to grasp and cling to me.</p>

<p>I intended to make my business here as brief as possible,
but first I must find what the other visitor had been doing
before me. I followed the big footprints across the marshy
floor, and noted a thick mark drawn beside them. Something
had been dragged.</p>

<p>Then the traces ceased, and I drew back suddenly with a cry
at my lips. I had had a narrow escape.</p>

<p>There was little to tell that the floor stopped here, for like
it the water was covered with an unclean growth. I stood on
the brink of the water-pit, where Aidenn’s lord had once
drowned thirty wretches in a single day! If ever a place was
accurst for the cruelties performed there, this is it.</p>

<p>Over the stagnant pit the ghastly festoons hung so thick that
the torchlight could scarcely pierce the darkness to the farther
wall. From that wall a queer shape protruded, round like an
enormous barrel, but too vague to be identified.</p>

<p>I suddenly caught sight of an object beside me on the verge
of the water. A stake had been driven into the earth through
the gathered-up mouth of a large cloth bag. The bottom of
the bag hung over the edge and down into the water, and the
weight of its contents drew the whole bag taut.</p>

<p>I gave a prolonged look through the shaggy gloom, where
the black streamers faintly shivered in the air my body had
stirred. Was some obscene presence spying on me from the
murk?</p>

<p>Banishing fear, I wrenched up the stake, lifted the bag from
the pool, and let its burden fall upon the floor. Stark and stiff,
with its eyes staring, its tongue thrust out, its fur tousled into
knarls and lumps, its claws extended, the enormous cat of the
sisters Delambre lay outstretched at my feet. I stooped over
the body; my fingers touched a cord drawn tight about the
neck.</p>

<p>So Maryvale had made this abysmal journey before me, and
there had been substance in his madness when he announced
that Parson Lolly is no more. Since bullets would not kill, with
cord and water he made assurance double. The long
despairing cry will never shudder down the Vale again.</p>

<p>I must have stood there a long while almost oblivious, gazing
into the invisible, until the darkness seemed to enter my
brain. The most infinitesimal sounds crept into my consciousness:
the muffled murmur of water in motion somewhere, the
charnel breath of the things that drooped from the vault, the
very voice of silence! Then disgust at my surroundings mounted
in an instant almost to nausea, and I wheeled about in flight
to the cellar above.</p>

<p>I took the stairs in a leap and a scramble, the trap-cover
closed with a shout behind me while I darted among the bins
and arches to the winding steps. At the top of these I paused to
replace the key but not to turn it, then made tiptoes past the
doors until I gained the kitchen. With the key of the gate-house
in my hand I passed into the dinner-room, thence through
the corridor into the conservatory, one of whose smaller
windows I proposed to use as a means of egress.</p>

<p>The valley seemed pale and quiet in the moonlight. In a
trice I had the casement open and had stepped through to the
ground, concealed beneath those outside stairs leading to the
door at the end of the first floor corridor. I pushed the window
shut, and on the instant the long screech of some predatory
night-bird shrilled from the summer-house park. If it was an
omen, it was not for good—and my path lay among those
shadows!</p>

<p>This was for secrecy. If I passed directly across the lawn,
some wakeful eye in one of the long range of windows might
find me out; so I had no choice but a long three parts of a
circle screened by trees. First I stole behind the birches where
I concealed myself at dawn the other day on catching sight of
the red-bearded runner, next through the cypresses, then the
sycamores of the park, and finally the strawberry trees. These
last extended far enough south to enable me to reach the towers
from the side opposite the House. The door was on the other
side, unconcealed, but I had to risk being seen while I unlocked
it.</p>

<p>I stood still beneath the twin, mute towers for a minute or
two before gathering determination for my effort. Salt, of
course, visited this place the day after his arrival, but has kept
his discoveries secret. My hope, of course, was that someone
came here <em>after</em> Salt, in particular the black-robed object of our
pursuit to-night.</p>

<p>I noticed that the moon was near setting, since it had but a
short progress to make from eastern to western hill. When it
was down, the Vale would be dark indeed. Was it worth
waiting until that happened?</p>

<p>Impatience decided not. I sped around the tower that contained
the door, turned the monumental key, got safely inside
the entrance, and stood with bated breath. Seen or unseen, I
was in for it now. Heaven help me if I found a presence inside
these walls.</p>

<p>My light showed the beginning of the spiral stair; there was
absolutely no sound. I commenced to climb.</p>

<p>It was a long way up. My stockinged feet were all but
noiseless on the overlapping stony steps, and more than once I
checked myself, thinking that I heard footfalls following mine.
The torch, directed downward, revealed the empty stair winding
into nether darkness. This delusion persisted; indeed, when
I was at the point of entering the little room atop the tower, I
thought that I heard even the breath of some stealthy climber.
The light showed only the bare winding beneath me, and I
spoke a murrain on the narrow tower which had no well to
enable me to see clear to the bottom.</p>

<p>My imagination cooled down, and I set about examining
the circular chamber. Owing to the thickness of the walls, it
was only some five feet in diameter. It was low, and save in
the centre, where the pointed roof gave space, I could not stand
upright. For windows it had three slots, through one of which
the moon cast a slanting beam. The floor was thickly daubed
with mud, but this in itself was not surprising when one
considered that Salt had sloshed through here on the morning of
the downpour.</p>

<p>But that mud would have dried long ago, and this showed
signs of damp!</p>

<p>Eagerly, critically, I bent and studied the floor in the full
glare of my torch. There were dubious faintly moist impressions,
of feet, I believed; but I could make nothing of them.
No entire footprint was evident. Over the general surface of
the dirt, however, something sopping wet had recently been
trailed, but not so heavily as to disturb the topography of the
mud. The little ridges and knolls left by Salt’s rubber boots
remained intact, but portions of that microscopic countryside
looked as if they were recovering from an inundation; in one or
two hollows there were positive pools, one-sixteenth of an inch
deep.</p>

<p>Something exceedingly wet, but not very heavy—what else
but the gown of the creature that had fled from Aire and me
and plunged into the stream? Only, how in the name of magic
did that creature evade us to get here, unless it skipped <em>up</em> the
stream, which both Aire and I are prepared to attest on oath
it did not do?</p>

<p>A flat-headed aperture led the way across the bridge between
the towers. In that direction the water-trail appeared to tend,
although at the edge of the dirt, where the gown had been
drawn along the stones themselves, almost complete evaporation
had taken place. Further along there was no sign of damp
at all; I suppose the intruder had observed the puddles he was
making and had lifted the garment clear from the floor,
perhaps doffed it and rolled it under his arm.</p>

<p>I had to crouch nearly double in that low passageway to
reach the inner room, which now I believed to be the headquarters
of Parson Lolly. My light, cast ahead, showed that it
was a chamber of identical mould with the one I had just
quitted, and, much to my relief, it was empty. One difference
there was, indeed: the corresponding stairway which led down
from this tower had for some reason been walled up. I tested
the mortared stones; I pounded them with my fist; I butted
them with my shoulder. They were sound and secure, leaving
no doubt that those stairs condemned to everlasting darkness
held no secret connected with the present mysteries.</p>

<p>When I had reached this comfortable certainty, I made
a detailed search of the turret. Someone, for sure, had been
in the habit of coming there; I found what appeared to me
sufficient evidence of occupation, and of hurried, perhaps
permanent, departure.</p>

<p>There were pencil-whittlings on the floor, from an indelible
pencil; I know the nasty taste of the aniline preparation. Now,
when I re-examined the Parson’s placard inside the House this
evening, I saw, though I did not comment on the fact, that
such a pencil had been used in writing it.</p>

<p>There were two or three dark stains, splashes now quite
dried, which yet had a dim, offensive odour when my nose
was close to them. To my mind, no more proof is needed that
a young pig was murdered here.</p>

<p>There were a few short lengths, an inch to four or five
inches, of some pliant fibrous wood, perhaps bamboo, which I
cannot account for. With these, perhaps, are associated the
fragments of black crepe I found cut in wedges, rhombs, and
various irregular shapes.</p>

<p>I detected, while bending near one of the slender openings,
a sub-acrid, faded scent, which seemed specially localized on
the sill, so to speak, of the window, as if some pungent stuff
had once been spilt there and removed. In its proper context
the source of the odour would, I am sure, have been obvious
in an instant; yet here it baffled me.</p>

<p>Last I found a torn end of paper. The side uppermost was
blank, but to my joy the other proved to contain printed words.
The piece was obviously detached from the title-page of some
old book, octavo size, with which I am not acquainted, though
“CATTI” looks obscurely familiar. I shall hardly have any
trouble in identifying it.<a href="#note5" id="noteref5">¹</a></p>

<p>I felt actual elation, for Salt would never have overlooked
this, or left it here, supposing he had found it in the course
of his inspection.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/fragment.png" alt="A torn piece of paper, missing
    much of the left side. The printing on the paper is laid out like
    a handbill or a book’s title page. What can be read says: “The ―es
    &amp; Vagaries of ―on Catti, ―ones, Esq., ―d Wag of Wales; by ―yn
    Prichard”.">
</figure>

<p>Five minutes had revealed these things; an hour could not
reveal more. I tucked the slip of paper into my breast pocket
and departed from the turret. Half-way across the bridge I
was again aware of the sound of footsteps climbing to the first
chamber, but dismissed the idea as a renewal of the delusion
which had troubled me before.</p>

<p>But there was no mistake this time, as I realized very soon.
The pad-pad of the unknown feet was growing louder, coming
nearer. At once I was terrified, yet possessed of reason. I knew
it might be fatal to let this creature see me before I saw
him—it—her. Particularly disastrous it would be to be caught in
this low passageway where I must go with my head almost
touching my knees. I snapped off my light, staggered into the
room beyond, and stood at the edge of the stair-head, leaning
perforce on account of the funnel-roof. It was a position of
vantage. There I was in darkness, whereas whatever was
coming must emerge into the moonlight that shot through the
opposite slit. I might even escape undetected down the stairs if
the creature hurried past me to the bridge and the farther
tower.</p>

<p>But this hope was abortive. The creature knew I was there:
that belief stuck like a knife in my heart.</p>

<p>The steady steps were only ten feet below, one twist of the
stair. They were like the steps of any ordinary man.</p>

<p>The moon must have been nearly swallowed by the hills all
this time, for now it went down with appalling suddenness and
left the room in thick and absolute night. I could not see my
foe in darkness; could it see me?</p>

<p>Every nerve in me was ringing its own alarm. The subtle
glue that holds the body-cells in friendly ties dissolved; it was
every cell for itself. I was fleeing in all directions.</p>

<p>The creature actually passed me by; I felt the touch of
some part of it, cold as an Arctic stone, on my arm.</p>

<p>It was like awakening from an evil dream. My fear welled
up in fury. Silently I launched an attack; with the torch I
held I let fly in blind and murderous onslaught. I struck
something a blow that glanced; the torch slipped from my grasp,
but the creature staggered and sank to the floor. I had my hands
on its body now, and a crazy exultation took hold of me when
I realized that my opponent was merely a man like myself and
at my mercy. The stroke I had given blindly seemed to have
stunned him, for he made no resistance, but lay crumpled up,
as I found by groping. His breath came harsh and irregular.</p>

<p>Who was he? For what seemed immeasurable time I
searched, but I could not find my torch.</p>

<p>Obviously I had made an important capture, and the best
thing to do, since my light was lost, would be to lock the
fellow-prisoner in and go for reinforcements.</p>

<p>I had a handkerchief; so had he. With their assistance I
triced him in a position from which he would not easily free
himself. I placed him face downward, with his head turned
aside for breathing and his legs doubled back, and I clipped
each wrist to the opposite ankle.</p>

<p>Then I groped my way down the long turnings, found the
darkened world again, locked the tower door, and made for
the House.</p>

<p>The rest was like the return of horrid dreams. With the
moon gone, still the stars gave a grey cast to the darkness. I
saw some fluttering-draped figure descend from the first storey
by the outside stairs; I heard distracted sobbing. I saw vague
forms that followed one another on the lawn, heard phantom
calls and a queer hysteric laughter. The place seemed more
alive by night than at any hour of day.</p>

<p>Maryvale, I discovered afterward, had come out again, clambered
down all the way by the ivy. Lib, in the room next his,
had heard him this time, caught sight of him, fled across the
passage to Mrs. Bartholomew, shared that lady’s dismay on
finding me also flown, summoned Pendleton, who had roused
Aire and come helter-skelter in pursuit of the errant man of
business. Lib and Mrs. Bartholomew, in different styles of
negligée, now stood spectators of the course. Millicent Mertoun,
too, had come crying out of doors by those northern stairs, in
her sleep, as she had come that first night with the American
girl watchfully by her side.</p>

<p>But to-night she roved alone. Where was Paula Lebetwood,
whose room is next the stairs, and who, however soundly she
may have slept, must have heard her dear friend’s
weeping?</p>

<p>Lights were awakening in various chambers. Maryvale, much
surprised at the solicitude of his captors, was explaining
courteously that he had merely descended to “pick herbs.”
Alberta Pendleton had appeared and was taking Miss Mertoun
back to the House.</p>

<p>By the time I had called attention to myself and had caused
my story to penetrate Crofts’ brain, many minutes had gone by.
Four of us, followed by those audacious females, Lib and Mrs.
Bartholomew, approached the towers. The door stood open.
The intruder, securely trussed and locked in by me, had made
off. He had taken my torch, invaluable as both light and
weapon.</p>

<h2>XXII. <br> The Beginning of the End: Parabola</h2>

<p class="diarydate">Same day. 3 <span class="meridienne">P.M.</span></p>

<p>In spite of early bed last night, no one was downstairs
early this bright morning, Sunday. I myself wanted breakfast
at nine, but then I am the one person in the House who has
anything concrete to do (to wit, this writing)—hence I require
the less repose.</p>

<p>I visited the library before I went for food. To my grim
pleasure, the Book of Sylvan Armitage was back on its shelf. I
am always grimly pleased nowadays when anything baffling
turns up. Crofts, by the way, has proved blatantly sceptical
about my experience last night; he said that if I must go
crawling about the House when decent folk are abed, I mustn’t
hold him responsible for what I think I see.</p>

<p>The telephone jangled in the corridor while I was at the
table. I heard Soames answer and take some message.
Presently the servant came to me.</p>

<p>“Superintendent Salt is holding on, sir, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Me, he wants?”</p>

<p>“He asked for any of the gentlemen, sir. Would you mind
speaking to him?”</p>

<p>“Not at all.” A few moments later I was saying, “Hello,
Superintendent; this is Bannerlee. Anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“Thanks very much, Mr. Bannerlee. Would you mind givin’
a message to the doctor—Doctor Aire, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Delighted.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been lookin’ up <em>his</em> whereabouts the two days before
he came down to Radnorshire.”</p>

<p>“<em>His!</em>”</p>

<p>“Yes. Nothing like thoroughness, is there? He might like
to know he’s not the Parson. Tell him he’s absolved, clean
character, goes scot-free.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be grateful, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Certain to be. Another thing, too, sir. I took the
liberty—unpardonable—of checkin’ <em>you</em> also.”</p>

<p>“<em>Me!</em>”</p>

<p>The sound must have deafened Salt, for it was a little while
before he resumed, with smothered amusement. “Couldn’t help
it, sir. All in the way of routine. You’re acquitted, too, and can
go your ways.”</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it. By the way, I just told that man to
inform Mr. Pendleton that I’m comin’ up there this afternoon
early, around dinner-time. I’m bringin’ someone with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh? Any harm in asking who it is?”</p>

<p>“None at all,” chuckled Salt. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p>It was about one o’clock when I came downstairs again,
after setting down the record of last night’s expedition. I think
everyone was in the Hall, surrounding Salt and a young fellow
in a neat grey suit, who was lank and had freckles and brown
hair. His appearance and manner—he was smiling most of
the time—were engaging. Salt also wore a respectful grin; in
fact, everyone looked brighter for this chap’s presence, especially
Crofts.</p>

<p>“Come on, Bannerlee,” he said; “let me introduce the
beginning of the end. You can guess who this is.”</p>

<p>I had a flash of genius. “Yes, I can, by George. It’s
Harry—Mr. Heatheringham.”</p>

<p>“Right!” declared the young man. “But after all, Mr.
Bannerlee, you’ve an unfair advantage in this guessing
business.”</p>

<p>“You mean—?”</p>

<p>He winked, took my torch out of his pocket, and handed it
to me with a low bow, such as I had seen somewhere not long
before. “Many thanks for this. I had to borrow it when my
own failed last night.”</p>

<p>“Gods! was it you I hit? I’m most awfully sorry.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t hurt, really, but for a little while I didn’t know
where I stood—er, that is, I wasn’t standing at all.” He felt a
place on the back of his head. “It’s hardly the size of a
teacup—I mean the bump. And I wasn’t dazed for long either.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it,” I avowed. “You certainly lost no time
waking and legging it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was awake, wide enough, when you were fastening
me up—and a neat job, that.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say—”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I thought it was better to let you do your worst
and untie myself afterward. I wasn’t sure that the time for
explanations had come, and I wasn’t sure—then—just what
you yourself were up to.”</p>

<p>“But if I’d been someone else, you might have been killed.”</p>

<p>His eyes were merry. “I knew it wasn’t somebody else.
Suppose we call it a draw.”</p>

<p>“We’re dying to hear how you escaped,” said Lib. “Why
do you keep it bottled up?”</p>

<p>“It’s my living, you see,” returned Heatheringham apologetically,
but with his customary smile. “I have to be up to a
few of the little secrets of my trade, or I don’t get any bread
and butter. Some do it on the stage for money, but in my
business it comes in valuable in good earnest to carry a few
skeleton keys and know how to twist a hand out of a knotted
handkerchief.”</p>

<p>Gradually, while talk went on, we disposed ourselves in
chairs, making a group about this young man who showed
from the first minute of acquaintance such a winning, and even
naïve, nature. He sat in the midst of us now, busy parrying
all sorts of questions, and I noticed that while he spoke lightly,
he glanced from person to person, making brief, sharp studies
of us. Particularly he kept stealing looks at Miss Lebetwood
and the two younger Americans.</p>

<p>I had returned the study intensively, striving to capture
some elusive recollection. “Pardon me, Mr. Heatheringham,
but really I believe I’ve met you somewhere—another time, I
mean. Am I right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, we have met. We’ve been having lovers’
meetings all over the place. You recollect the umbrella?”</p>

<p>The menagerie-keeper! I uttered a great gasp. “That was
never you in the crooked black beard!”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it, though?” he retorted brightly. “I can see your
eyes popping now, Mr. Bannerlee, when I said, ‘I won’t need
finger-nails.’ ”</p>

<p>“Incredible! That man was bulbous.” I pointed to the
detective’s hands, which were brown and lean. “Don’t tell me
you owned the great red wrists and fingers that fellow had.”</p>

<p>“Try a tightly-bound cuff or any other constriction around
the wrist and keep your arms down—see what happens. Your
hands will look like hams. The rest was just a matter of
accessories, an inflated chest-protector, some dowdy clothes, some
black hair. A bad disguise, on the whole.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, your twin brother wouldn’t have
recognized you.”</p>

<p>“No, but he would have had me arrested. Disguise should
be unobtrusive, but that one shouted all over the place. To tell
the truth, I used it more to give my friend Crofts Pendleton
something to worry about than for any other reason.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you did, did you?” said Crofts.</p>

<p>“Yes, old man. I didn’t realize the situation here might
actually be serious. I merely supposed some sneak-thief was
snooping in the neighbourhood. But it did seem a good chance
to have a little sport with you. You will let yourself in for it,”
he accused our muttering host. “I thought I’d make myself
up into a figure of fun and have a reconnaissance of the scene
a couple of nights, just to assure myself there was no cause
for alarm. Then I’d be seen on purpose by some good honest
yokels and perhaps a village idiot or so, and pop in in a day or
two to see what the effect had been in the Vale. But matters
turned out differently from what I had expected, and by the
time I met with you, Mr. Bannerlee, the last thing on earth I
wanted was to have it known I was in the neighbourhood. So
I improvised some unnatural eccentricities and made up a line
of desperate talk that I knew would spoil the last chance of
Crofts’ guessing it was me, in case you told him of your
experience, as I felt certain you would.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t. And it made no difference, for what I said
about the bothersome watch-dogs wouldn’t have made much
impression, would it, unless our friend knew where it came
from? All those men you sent out,” he told Crofts, “kept
treading on my toes. I had to leg it twice to slip away from
them. And that was after I had made some very material
discoveries and would have given a year of my life not to be
seen.”</p>

<p>“How was I to know that?” said Crofts. “What discoveries
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I ran into a chap who must have been Sir Brooke Mortimer
from what I know now. He seemed to have lost his way, quite
a distance up the Vale. I set the gentleman going in the right
direction and watched him start back downstream. A bit
unsteady, I thought he was—oh, nothing wrong with him that
way, but I could see his eyes weren’t too good. He didn’t seem
able to pick his footing, and he might have stepped into a hole
as big as a house without knowing what had happened to
him.”</p>

<p>“And do you mean to say that he followed your directions
unhesitatingly when according to yourself you looked like
something out of Grimm’s Fairy Tales?” asked Lord Ludlow, who
had been playing finger-exercises on his knees.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he quite took me in, my Lord. I’m telling
you his eyesight couldn’t have been good. He might have
thought I was a gentleman-farmer, for all I know—and he
seemed like an unsuspicious, trusting little chap.”</p>

<p>I saw that the subject was a painful one to be discussed in
full session this way, and I wanted to divert the course of
conversation. I nodded to Salt.</p>

<p>“The discovery of Mr. Heatheringham knocks one off the
list of your favourite suspects, eh, Superintendent?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say it does,” he rejoined, with that slow smoulder of
humour underneath the surface. “I’ve known about Mr.
Heatheringham since he arrived in our little community over
a week ago.”</p>

<p>He had! More surprises were let loose. As a measure of
sensible precaution the detective had reported his presence to
Salt as soon as he arrived in New Aidenn. In the early dawn
after meeting me, having learned that there was something
worth attention in the way of mystery in the Vale, the young
man discarded the crooked black beard of the menagerie-keeper
and glorified his chin with a rich red one, finely adapted to
his complexion. This emblem he had attached properly, using
separate hairs at the edges and trimming the whole to a nicety.
He commenced a campaign of deceit.</p>

<p>First Foggins’ driver was tempted from the path of duty
with a five-pound note, and reported sick. While Foggins the
milkman was tearing his hair, in walked the unblushing detective,
and Foggins fell victim to his wiles. That very noon the
newly-employed had driven the milk cart up the Vale. He had
explained at the kitchen door, with a certain amount of wit,
though with his ready tongue all the time in his cheek, why
the service was so much delayed and how he had fallen heir to
the position. The listener to this merry tale was Rosa Clay.
It gained the young man a means of contact with affairs inside
the House which might have been extremely valuable had the
storm not cut off the Vale from Foggins’ circuit.</p>

<p>During the week Heatheringham formed with the Post Office
attendant a mushroom friendship that passeth all legality.
So it came about that Crofts’ impassioned letters were handed
to their recipient direct, without going to Worcester and back.
It was, moreover, the detective himself who had been on the
Post Office end of the ’phone when Crofts dictated his telegram
Thursday afternoon with many maledictions on the stumbling
clerk who took the message.</p>

<p>The dinner-bell had rung and we were on our feet. Salt
announced he mustn’t stay, but would leave the field clear for
the younger man. “Do what he tells you,” he said. “He has an
idea from time to time.”</p>

<p>Heatheringham drew me apart, until the rest were gone,
even waving Crofts ahead.</p>

<p>“You can do me a favour, Mr. Bannerlee, if you will,” he
said with a laugh in his voice, as if he might have something
in the way of a surprise to try on me.</p>

<p>“I suppose I owe you a month’s hard labour for battering
you last night—but, of course, I want to help you if I can.
What shall it be?”</p>

<p>“You’re keeping a written record of events, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Crofts told you!” I exclaimed reproachfully—reproachfully
in reference to Crofts, that is.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it—just my prowling. I’ve noticed your candles
burning until all hours, and last night I brought a small
telescope with me and had a squint at you from a tree way out
by the Water. I could hardly think that you wrote letters all
night, could I?”</p>

<p>“Well, your guess is right, as it happens, but my penmanship
is rather free and easy, and I don’t think you’ll find much
value—” I was speaking slowly but thinking fast. Had I put
down anything positively libellous, anything I’d hesitate to
sign my name to?</p>

<p>“Let me try, all the same. You and I are both detached
onlookers in this thing, Mr. Bannerlee, and I shouldn’t be
surprised if we supplement each other pretty fully. I’m quite
frankly selfish, you see,” he admitted easily. “I want to know
all you know without telling you what I know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll trust you to repay me, not later than noon
to-morrow,” I said. “Come along upstairs with me while I get
the sheets for you—unless you’ll wait until after dinner.”</p>

<p>“There’s no after dinner for me; I’m not taking dinner,”
he answered, and we went up the stairs together. “I had a
snack in New Aidenn with something like this in prospect.
Time’s what counts. It will be dark too soon to suit me.”</p>

<p class="diarydate">Same day. 7 <span class="meridienne">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Please God, the experiment is over. It was not long.</p>

<p>About five this afternoon Heatheringham came into the
library where I was writing about the events of the day. He
had wrestled with my script since I had left him to go
down to dinner, and he seemed even better-humoured than
before.</p>

<p>“I want some tea,” he said. “I want some tea, and yet, while
there’s light, I want a little assistance from the people here.”</p>

<p>“Are you commandeering the servants, too?”</p>

<p>“No, I can do without the servants, except that one who
brought the hot water.”</p>

<p>“Soames?”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll find the rest of us in the conservatory, waiting
for both tea and you. Since the tragedy outside the Hall, the
venue of tea has been shifted.”</p>

<p>“I suppose they could wait fifteen minutes for their feeding,
if I suffered with them?”</p>

<p>“We have been in training for martyrdom all week. But
what on earth is this rigmarole you’re going to put us through?”</p>

<p>“I want you to rehearse a little drama you have already
performed without rehearsal.”</p>

<p>It was just that.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if this is painful to some of you,” he said later
in the conservatory. “But it’s vital. I need to check some
observations, and there’s no way else. I’m awfully sorry to trouble
you; really I am, but it’s my living, you know.” He gave a
sly smile. “It’s my living, and it will help you to escape from
here to-morrow. Is it a bargain?”</p>

<p>From the time Cosgrove left the Hall until Miss Lebetwood
found him dying outside may have been an hour. We were
asked to re-enact as precisely as possible our movements during
the last quarter of this period.</p>

<p>“You would be asleep, sir, over by the gate-house, if I’m not
mistaken,” said Heatheringham to Oxford. “I’ll let you off
the sleeping. Just be on hand, if you don’t mind. You,”
addressing Belvoir, “would be coming toward the towers and
meeting Miss Mertoun and Lord Herbert. Presently you’d
commence monkeying with the winch.” He spoke to me. “You
were returning from the Delambre cottage, weren’t you?
Doctor Aire and Mr. Maryvale must see you from the
summer-house. I think you’ll all work into it.”</p>

<p>“But how silly!” said Miss Lebetwood. “All I can do is to
wander about the strawberry trees looking for tennis balls I
know won’t be there.”</p>

<p>“It’s all make-believe, you know,” answered Heatheringham.
“And I can’t change the parts around, can I?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how my doing that can help.”</p>

<p>“Still,” insisted the detective deferentially, “it will assist me
a lot if you’ll just go through the motions. Now, is everybody
clear about what he’s to do?”</p>

<p>“Shall I fetch hot water for Mr. Bannerlee, sir?” asked
Soames, who had been admitted to our company.</p>

<p>“That’s hardly essential. But you might carry an empty
pannikin to give mental support. Now, shall we commence?
Some of the ladies may need coats. It’s beginning to blow a
bit.”</p>

<p>“Not fair unless you tell us what you’re going to do
yourself,” protested Lib.</p>

<p>“I’m going to be here, there, and everywhere,” said Heatheringham.
“You may even hear me giving a few stage directions.
Come on, people, I want my tea. One, two, three, go.”</p>

<p>Little gusts of wind were stirring. Evening frost had caused
a marvellous change in the foliage, and the air was chromatic
with flying leaves. They blew in my face while I breasted my
way to the north end of the sycamore park, where I turned to
retrace my steps. Through the dim light of the wood, I saw
the black forms of Maryvale and Doctor Aire together on the
porch of the abandoned summer-house. They nodded when I
came nearest them. I reached the bridge, the cypresses, the
lawn, the mansion itself. I saw people beyond the gate-house.</p>

<p>Suddenly I remembered that to keep in character I must peer
into the Hall, and my flesh began to crawl at the thought of
seeing the grim, phantasmal bone. I would not see it, of course,
but if I did—</p>

<p>Then I caught a glimpse of Heatheringham over a hundred
yards south of the House. He seemed to be waving me on, and
I assumed that I must be a little behind my schedule. Without
a glance into any of the windows I obediently rounded the
library tower, entered the half-opened door, not omitting to
ring, since I had done so on the previous occasion. The
footman answered the bell with what would have been appalling
suddenness had I not known he had been waiting for me. He
received my instructions for hot water with the same obeisance
and the same perfunctory words in the identical tone as before.
I climbed the empty House to my room.</p>

<p>I was in a quandary, for it would do no manner of good to
take off my coat and repeat the little battle with myself whose
result had been a wounded finger. I certainly wouldn’t subject
my digit to the safety-razor’s mercies a second time. But for
the sake of keeping in the rhythm of the other day I might
perform some of the milder motions. First I must go out to
the balcony, where I had picked up the odd little scrap of
rope.</p>

<p>I pressed through the window and, standing on the roof
outside, saw the forms of people anticking about the tower and
heard the rasp of the winch. Someone was on the lawn a little
distance beyond the walk that skirts the
House—Heatheringham himself.</p>

<p>“Hello!” I called aloud in the high wind. “Everything
working smoothly?”</p>

<p>He must have seen me before, for he answered quickly,
cupping his hands. “Yes, I think they’re all in their places.
You did come out there the other day, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I did, and should go in again now if I keep in step.”</p>

<p>“Did you order that hot water?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>“How did the servant behave?”</p>

<p>“Admirably; he didn’t turn a hair.”</p>

<p>“No, I should think not. Well, carry on. I’m bound this
way.” He shouted the last words in a bristling wind, and set
off walking toward the north.</p>

<p>“Good hunting,” I called after him.</p>

<p>I had now been on the roof for nearly five minutes and had
equalled the span of time I spent there before. I returned to
my chamber.</p>

<p>I laid my watch on the table and timed my own part of the
programme, to make as near the proper <i>rapprochement</i> with
Soames as I could. I allowed half a minute for divesting myself
of coat and shirt, and as long again for my struggle with
the oak chest and my mishap with the stool. (The handle of
the chest was gone now; no use repeating that fracas.) Thirty
seconds more of searching for a place to attach my strop,
perhaps the remainder of the minute spent in that unhappy
stropping (for luck and devilment I gave the curlicued bracket a
jerk and a smash), fifteen seconds to stare like a fool at the
place where I had formerly cut my finger, a few moments for
crossing to the door and listening for Soames—</p>

<p>My heart missed a beat or two. Someone <em>was</em> climbing the
stairs!</p>

<p>It was silly of me, of course, to be taken aback by the very
thing I was waiting for, I had heard no one but Soames
himself ascending at his proper time.</p>

<p>But the slam of the door down below and the deep brawling
laughter which followed— Dear God! they, too, reverberated,
and the sound of that inhuman mirth now held a ghastly
message which it had not on the first occasion.</p>

<p>And early above the sound of the laughter had I heard a
single sharp explosion, like the report of a firearm?</p>

<p>I leaped across to the window. This time there was no fan
of light spreading from the Hall, but I saw indecipherable
forms criss-crossing on the lawn, and the sound of conflicting
cries floated up in the lapse of the wind.</p>

<p>To leave the chamber, to reach the stair-head, took but a
second or two. Again I saw Soames green as an old statue, a
grotesque caricature of Aquarius, stony-lipped with mortal
fear, the little empty water-can dangling from his hand.</p>

<p>I ignored him, but heard his feet pound down the stairs behind
me. Down at the front entrance, just outside the door, I
caught sight of Lib, still as wax. We looked at each other,
mirroring the dread we saw.</p>

<p>“Did you hear it?” I said at last.</p>

<p>Her voice was weak. “The shot, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Was there a shot?”</p>

<p>“There was if my ears are working.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>She shook her head miserably. “I—I don’t know. I think it
was out on the lawn.”</p>

<p>“Then why were you coming in?”</p>

<p>She clenched both little fists and shook them tremblingly.
“I was only doing what the detective told me to do. Besides,
he—he came in first.”</p>

<p>“<em>He came in!</em>”</p>

<p>“He went in this door while I was quite a way from the
House.”</p>

<p>“Then what’s become of him? He couldn’t have fired that
shot outside!”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me. Don’t ask me. I don’t know anything about
it. I got to the door in time to hear the tail-end of that laugh—that
was enough for me. I don’t want to lead the searching-party.
This is the last time I officiate for any detective.”</p>

<p>“Come along with me, then. He must be here somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I think they’re trying to find him outside, sir,” said Soames,
who had stepped warily to the corner of the House.</p>

<p>“That’s because they don’t know he went in here. Come
along, both of you.”</p>

<p>We passed into the portrait-corridor, and I shouted
Heatheringham’s name a couple of times, without effect.</p>

<p>Several of the servants had emerged from their quarters
and were clustered about me while I stood at the door beneath
the musicians’ gallery, scrutinizing the vast gloom of the Hall.
Somehow, I was loath to enter or to switch on the light ready
to my hand.</p>

<p>“Nobody here,” said Lib beside me, in a tone of relief.</p>

<p>I still moved my glance through the spaces of the room.
Feet were pouring through the front door. I heard Crofts’ voice
raised:</p>

<p>“Heatheringham’s missing. What in thunder are you up to?”</p>

<p>Then I saw something limned against the dark expanse of
the central window of the Hall: the shape of a man who leaned
heavily against the window-frame, looking out to the lawn.
The moment my eyes had distinguished him, I knew it was
Heatheringham. But he was awfully still! Why hadn’t he
heard my shout?</p>

<p>“Heatheringham!” I called, and was shocked how strained
the syllables crept from my lips. “Heather—”</p>

<p>“Where is he? Do you see him?” demanded Crofts, pressing
to the door. “Why didn’t you light up—good God!”</p>

<p>He had switched on the electricity. From outside, beyond
the window, came cry upon excited cry when the form of
the detective was revealed by the blazing chandelier. But we
who were behind Harry Heatheringham could see why he did
not answer us, why he did not move. There was a gaping wound
at the base of his brain, and the whole back of his trim grey
coat was black with blood.</p>

<p>“Lawks!” cried Soames, and seemed about to faint.</p>

<p>Persons were rushing in from outside now, through the french
windows. Doctor Aire took one look at the wound, and his
face was filled with the most complete astonishment. His little
dark eyes came out of their hiding-places, and even his
tobacco-leaf complexion went several shades wan.</p>

<p>“Keep the women away,” he snapped at Soames, “and don’t
let Maryvale come in here.”</p>

<p>“This is horrible, horrible,” Crofts kept saying.</p>

<p>“Is—is he dead?” asked Bob Cullen timidly, but no one
smiled.</p>

<p>“He is,” answered the Doctor. “Men with holes in their
heads like this are dead as Pharaoh.”</p>

<p>I ventured to touch the left hand that hung with such
dreadful listlessness. “Why, he’s stiff!” I blurted, and a great
shudder shook me. “He’s stiff! He must have been dead a long
time. But, Doctor, I was talking to him less than five
minutes ago!”</p>

<p>“You were!” exclaimed Crofts in an incredulous
bull-voice.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said Aire. “I noticed it the moment I saw the
poor fellow.” He, too, touched the left hand. “Stiff, yes, but not
cold yet.”</p>

<p>“What’s it all mean?” asked Belvoir.</p>

<p>“He could never be leaning there in that semi-lifelike manner
if it weren’t the case,” said Aire. “I observed it, as I said, when
I had the first glimpse of him. I have heard of it, but I’ve
never seen a case before.”</p>

<p>“A case of what?”</p>

<p>“Instant <i>rigor mortis</i>. It occurs sometimes, under certain
conditions, in sudden death.”</p>

<p>Ludlow, who stood near the body on the other side, was
regarding it with awe, but his sharp face quickened with
discovery. “Have you looked at his other hand? There’s a
revolver in it.”</p>

<p>“Then he did fire the shot,” I cried.</p>

<p>“I’ll stake my life the shot was from somewhere outside,”
avouched Crofts.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it was,” said Belvoir quietly.</p>

<p>“The point I wish to make,” said Ludlow, “is that the
revolver is outside. He’s put his hand right through.”</p>

<p>It was so. Concealed by the fact that the body pressed close
to the window, the right arm half-way to the elbow had been
thrust through the glass and the wrist was supported by one
of the cross-bars between the small panes. The weapon was
tightly clutched in the hand, and its nose pointed upward!</p>

<p>“What in the name of reason could he have fired at up
there?”</p>

<p>It was when we laid the dead detective, stiff in the original
posture, revolver clamped in hand, on the carpet spread over
the <i>Brocade de Lyons</i> creation that we looked beyond that
article of elegance and saw what had been concealed behind it.</p>

<p>Splashes of blood from Heatheringham’s wound were on the
floor at our feet, between the body and the couch. Now we
beheld more blood, a trail of it across the floor in drops that
led in a long, irregular, parabolic curve from the couch to the
open door by the clock-corner, and so out into the corridor.
There the track ceased abruptly.</p>

<p>“Hm,” said Aire, standing at the spot. “Here’s where the
assailant tucked his bludgeon away.” He looked up and down
the gallery. “Friend Crofts, why not have another search and
see if one of these priceless paintings doesn’t conceal a door?”</p>

<p>“There has never been, and is not any secret passage in the
House,” said Crofts decisively. “You can say amen to that.”</p>

<p>Aire shrugged his shoulders. Lord Ludlow shook his head
several times, though what at no one could tell. Belvoir stared
at the last drop of blood where it stained the blue-carpeted
floor as if he were fascinated by it. Bob Cullen pursed his lips
and whistled a ditty of no tone. Crofts kept putting his hands
in his pockets and taking them out again.</p>

<p>Insensibly, instinctively, we drew the tiniest bit closer to
one another. Spiritually, we huddled. We were all little men,
badly frightened, in the great House where murder stalked
invisible.</p>

<hr>

<p>If this is “the beginning of the end,” what will the end itself
be like?</p>

<h2>XXIII. <br> Miss Lebetwood and a Campstool</h2>

<p class="diarydate">October 9. Noon.</p>

<p>“No,” said Miss Lebetwood, “I certainly didn’t do
what he wanted me to. What good would that have been?”</p>

<p>Salt’s brow was very grave, but his eyes were narrowly
upon her. “You watched him, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as long as he was in sight from the edge of the
strawberry trees.”</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>She bit her lip. “Nothing that will really help you.”</p>

<p>“Let me be the judge of that,” said Salt gently. “What did
you see?”</p>

<p>“By the time I reached the strawberry trees and looked back,
the lawn was empty. It was still empty when—”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Miss; what about the gate-house?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t see the towers from that spot; I was on the wrong
side of the knoll that overlooks the court.”</p>

<p>“Quite. Thank you, Miss.”</p>

<p>“So I watched the lawn and the House. I could almost see it
growing darker while I waited, the light changes so rapidly
in the Vale. And I hate the twilight—all the really terrible
things here happen then.” She broke off, and we knew that she
must be thinking of that one terrible thing in the gloaming of a
week ago. Alberta made a movement as if to check her from
continuing. “No, it’s all right. I was just realizing what a fool
I am. The time of day can’t possibly make any difference.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it does,” acquiesced Salt. “But go on, if you
please.”</p>

<p>“It was darkening so suddenly that I thought I shouldn’t
be able to recognize anyone who might appear. But when Mr.
Bannerlee came out of the park, I saw him quite plainly. He
seemed to hesitate when he came past the Hall, but then he
went on faster and disappeared in the direction of the front
entrance.”</p>

<p>“Heatheringham beckoned me to hurry,” I put in.</p>

<p>“There was nobody in sight then, but I believe I heard the
winch working under the towers. A minute or two later Mr.
Heatheringham appeared from down below, looking this side
and that, and occasionally glancing upward.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked Salt.</p>

<p>“Yes, because he caught sight of Mr. Bannerlee, who had
come out his window and was standing on the roof. Mr. Bannerlee
waved his hand, and I could just hear the sound of his
voice when he hailed Mr. Heatheringham, the wind was rushing
on so just then. After that I heard nothing of their voices,
but soon afterward Mr. Bannerlee went in and Mr. Heatheringham
commenced to walk quickly up toward the cypresses.
He was looking this side and that again; I thought he was
more intent than before. He broke into a run, but while he was
running he turned—”</p>

<p>“Turned!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and ran all the way back to the south end of the
House. At the library corner he slowed to a walk and went
out of sight. Then Lib came along from down the lawn, and she
had almost disappeared beyond the library tower—going toward
the main entrance, you know—when I heard the crack of
the revolver. Lib rather tightened up then, and I saw her look
every way at once, but she apparently decided to disbelieve her
ears, for she went on out of sight.”</p>

<p>“And met Soames and me,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, everybody seemed to have heard the shot, though
nobody knew where it had come from. Mr. Pendleton, Lord
Ludlow, and the rest began crossing the lawn this way and
that, shouting directions at one another that nobody heeded. I
came on from the trees, but nobody seemed to see me. After
that—well, you know.”</p>

<p>Salt nodded. “Mr. Pendleton’s told me how they found the
body. Just one question more, Miss, and thank you very much.
You couldn’t have seen anything in the air that Heatheringham
might have some reason to take a shot at? No large bird of
any description?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t hear something like a bird call—something
that might have attracted his attention?”</p>

<p>“I could hear nothing but the wind. Anyhow, Mr.
Heatheringham was inside the House.”</p>

<p>“Of course he was,” said Salt.</p>

<p>But he is no longer. The detective’s body was taken to New
Aidenn in the dead of night.</p>

<p>Salt’s laborious questions to each one of us went on until
eleven, but the problem of Harry Heatheringham’s taking off
remains to-day more cryptic than Cosgrove’s. The Superintendent
acknowledged defeat, and had the Chief Constable on the
’phone shortly after eleven. Scotland Yard will be with us
presently, although the lack of decent train connections out of
Worcester will prevent the Inspector from reaching New
Aidenn before late dinner time to-night.</p>

<p>Six burly constables, in pairs, were patrolling the grounds
from nine o’clock until morning, but I think most persons within
the House kept anxious vigil as well. For my own part, I flung
myself on my ancient four-poster and found sleep—sleep, but
not rest, for I was visited by tormenting dreams. The world was
mist seethed, and through the long black lanes between the
billows swept a procession of the souls of murdered ones.
Down from the invisible above the swirl sounded a terrible
voice: “Let traitors beware,” and from time to time a blaze of
light burst through, throwing on the curtain of fog the gigantic
shadow of an arm.</p>

<p>I awoke, and lay awake in a world of real mist until I could
endure inactivity no longer. I dressed and went downstairs,
earlier than ever before, save on that morning when I tried
to discover “lost content” on the hills. It did not surprise me
to find Salt already hard at work; he was examining with almost
microscopic care the gouted trail of blood. But a surprise
awaited me.</p>

<p>It was much too early for breakfast; yet Miss Lebetwood
was standing at the window of the dining-room. Attired in
a navy blue sweater and serge skirt and high laced boots, she
appeared very alert and full of business.</p>

<p>Seeing that I “took her in,” she smiled and said, “I’m going
to follow in your steps this morning. As soon as I’ve had
some breakfast, I’m off for the hills.”</p>

<p>“On account of—?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>I simulated a groan. “I should never have let you have it if
I thought it would make you reckless.”</p>

<p>Now, the fact is that she struck me in a heap last evening
by coming straight up to me and asking to read this diary.
How <em>she</em> ever came to hear of it I can’t imagine, and she was
obdurate to my demands for enlightenment. Only she told me
very seriously that since no one else seemed certain to grapple
successfully with the many problems in the Vale, she was
going a step beyond “thinking” and would take an active
course.</p>

<p>“Somehow I’m sure I’ll be the best detective of the lot,” she
said. “I have kept my mind unprejudiced, you see. And really,
Mr. Bannerlee, I’m positive you have several facts locked away
in your book that I never knew.”</p>

<p>The end was that she marched away with the book, I may
say entirely against my sense of discretion, while I shuddered at
the thought of her perusing some of the personal comments I
had included.</p>

<p>And now she was bound for the hills!</p>

<p>I looked through the window, and saw the landscape grey.
A bank of fog stood motionless about the base of Whimble.</p>

<p>“This is scarcely the day for it, is it? It’s easy to be lost up
there in the mist.”</p>

<p>She turned from the drear panorama and looked at me
kindly. “I can tell from your voice that you’re very much
concerned about me, but really you shouldn’t be. I’ve had harder
climbs than this heaps of times, and you can depend on me
to be back early this afternoon. You may begin to worry about
two o’clock if I don’t appear then”—her chin tilted with
determination—“with what I want.”</p>

<p>I returned her kind look. “Really, Miss Lebetwood, I hope
my, er, jottings haven’t set you on some false lead.”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot more in your journal than jottings,” she said,
with serious lines of thought about the eyes. She gave me a
glancing look. “I see you are sceptical.”</p>

<p>“It’s hardly fair,” I laughed, “that because you’ve turned
detective in earnest, you should try to mystify me like the
other sleuths.”</p>

<p>“What’s this? what’s this?” asked Salt, presenting himself.</p>

<p>She beckoned him in. “Mr. Salt, have you finished with that
horrible gore for now? Because I want you to ’phone a telegram
for me when the Post Office opens. Will you, please?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, Miss. But why honour me with Mr.
Bannerlee so handy?”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re fishing! But didn’t you appoint yourself
censor and want to know all the messages that go out of the
Vale?”</p>

<p>“Not any more, Miss,” responded Salt, running his eye over
a slip of paper she had brought from a skirt pocket. He raised
his brows. “To the Welsh National Library, eh? Aberystwyth,
of course.” Again, more slowly, he perused the message. “H’m,
very interestin’, Miss. I’ll send it without delay, and you’ll
know by the time you get back if the bookworms have the
information.”</p>

<p>“Show it to Mr. Bannerlee, please,” she said. “I don’t want
him to think I’m rude.”</p>

<p>“No, not for the world,” I smiled, with negative hand raised
to decline the proffered paper. “Since I’m to be denied the
pleasure of accompanying you this morning, I wash my hands of
the whole affair. You shall not have my invaluable advice.”</p>

<p>“If you went with me this morning,” said Miss Lebetwood,
making a small grimace, “I could promise you one thing: you’d
be unutterly bored. Well, thank goodness, at last here comes my
breakfast.”</p>

<p>Now, a quarter of an hour later, when my own special
breakfast had arrived on a tray, hers had disappeared. We had
been talking of tramps and journeys, comparing experiences,
but I noticed that for the last few minutes her remarks had
been very general and not wholly relevant. It was obvious that
she was preoccupied. At last, having built up a little tower of
sugar cubes and toppled it with her finger, she said:</p>

<p>“I was the man in the library.”</p>

<p>Naturally, this was too much for me to comprehend and
adjust myself to in a split-second, and I was still groping like
a man stunned when she continued:</p>

<p>“Yes, the cap was my own, and I had borrowed Bob’s
tuxedo and come down to get that book; it had a fascination
for me, and I must say I was surprised”—with a careful
inclination of the head toward the corridor—“that <em>he</em> hadn’t
kept it under lock and key.”</p>

<p>“Quite so.”</p>

<p>“So you see why I didn’t come out even when Millicent was
wandering again. I had gone back to my room the way I’d
come—that was by the outer stairs and through one of the
french windows I’d undone the catch of after Blenkinson had
gone the rounds—and I was gobbling up the book, still in
borrowed plumage, when the commotion began. I couldn’t have
appeared without starting more fuss than ever; I suppose I
shouldn’t have much more than a rag of reputation left. They
wouldn’t be so surprised in America at a girl’s dressing like a
man—the movies have helped a lot there.”</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t take the appalling risk again,” I promised
her. “If you should wish to gorge yourself clandestinely on
the pages of Sylvan Armitage, you may have my copy in
perfect secrecy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, your copy came? Don’t get up, please, and please
excuse me if I don’t wait. Your breakfast will all get cold if
I keep you talking.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Yes, my copy came through.”</p>

<p>She had arisen and walked to the door. I had noticed a small
campstool folded and leaning against the wall, and now was
surprised to see her pick it up and tuck it beneath her arm.</p>

<p>“Are you taking that?”</p>

<p>She held it so that it opened, showing its green canvas seat.
“Yes, aren’t you in favour of it?”</p>

<p>“It’s æsthetic, if that’s what you mean. But how odd! If you
want something to sit on, why not take a blanket or an old
coat?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps this isn’t to sit down on.”</p>

<p>I gaped. “What—what do you mean?”</p>

<p>She folded the stool and tucked it away again. Her smile
was very sweet and provoking, and it held that little token of
wistfulness which had never left it since Cosgrove’s death.</p>

<p>The skirt swung briskly out, and the sound of the little
boots receded and died away. On what wild search was she
bound?</p>

<p>Then I stopped eating, while the idea that grew in my
mind spread its ugly branches. What might a stranger think?
Not I, of course, who would stake my life she is better than
gold, but some newcomer from the outside world, such as the
Scotland Yard official due here this evening? Might it not seem
a pose? This resolve to play the rôle of detective, this secret
roaming through the House in man’s attire, this interest in my
diary, and this secretive hunting on the hills—would they not
appear parts of an assumed character? Ridiculous, of
course—unthinkable, in actuality—but might it not be thought? And
what trouble, even disaster, might not follow such a false
impression?</p>

<p>Somehow I was not at all amused toward noon by an argument
that sprouted up in the library between Crofts and Aire
in connection with some phase of the Parson Lolly legend.
Aire was devil’s advocate in this discussion, and Crofts
persisted in pooh-poohing the tale as all nonsense, tommyrot, and
rubbish.</p>

<p>“I thought you were a scientist,” bullied our host, but Aire
contented himself with a chuckle, and moved toward the Hall,
whence the voice of Lord Ludlow came in a kind of shrill
moan:</p>

<p>“. . . fundamental decencies . . . civilized life.”</p>

<p>And I judged that Belvoir had just uttered some devastating
platitude about the geisha girls or the way women choose
their husbands in British Guiana. It occurred to me then a
bit strongly that Belvoir plays the fool, and that if he really
thinks our British morality unsuitable for a civilized temperament
(<i>i. e.</i> his) he had better emigrate to the bush or to Terra
del Fuego, where he may be uncramped among the broader
and merrier folkways.</p>

<p>I have mentioned more than once, I believe, the sub-irritant
effect Mrs. Belvoir has upon me; her hazy personality, taken
with the odd remarks she lets fall, hint at something I can’t
quite define, but would like to very much.</p>

<p>When Aire went through the armoury door, only four of
us were left in the library: Mrs. Belvoir, Alberta, Crofts, and
I (in the seclusion of the tower). Mrs. Belvoir watched
the Doctor’s departure, then turned to Crofts with the
promptitude of one who has at last the opportunity she has been
waiting for.</p>

<p>“I do hope you won’t mind to-night,” she said.</p>

<p>It would not have been surprising if Crofts had failed to
extract a meaning from this wish, but he seemed to grasp
it. His cheek remained at the same full flush it had reached
during the Aire controversy, while he turned his eyes slowly
toward Mrs. Belvoir, and I thought that the lady had not
chosen the likeliest time for wooing his good graces.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say—” he rumbled.</p>

<p>“But dear Alberta doesn’t mind—do you?” she asked in
sudden appeal that was answered with ardour rather less than
half its own.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think it could do any harm,” said Alberta, divided
between a reassuring smile at her guest and a warning frown
at her husband. “Probably the Scotland Yard man—”</p>

<p>“But it’s for him I especially want to give a demonstration,”
declared Mrs. Belvoir with emphatic faintness. “I can help
him so much. I think that perhaps the real difficulty we have
had all along is that we have not looked beyond the visible.
I do so wish Sir Brooke were here; he was so sympathetic.
There were always such things of <em>real value</em> learned when he
was present.”</p>

<p>“I have it!” I exclaimed from my obscurity, striking my
thigh. “Mrs. Belvoir, you are a spiritualistic medium!”</p>

<p>They all regarded me with amazement bold on their faces,
and I turned my blatancy into apologetic curiosity. “Sorry,
but I didn’t know before, you see. How frightfully interesting.
I hope you do give us a séance to-night, Mrs. Belvoir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” muttered Crofts. “But it’s the police you’ll
have to convince, really.”</p>

<p>“I’ll deal with the police,” said Mrs. Belvoir.</p>

<p>“As for Sir Brooke’s absence,” I remarked, “why may he
not be present? Perhaps we shall have a message from him,
Mrs. Belvoir.”</p>

<p>I think she discerned levity in me. “Really, Mr. Bannerlee,
you may be surprised by having that very thing happen.” She
glided from the room.</p>

<p>Crofts looked at me bitterly, as if he held me responsible
for the whole business, but instead of pouring out vials of
wrath he said, “How about a drink, Bannerlee? I need one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Crofts,” reproached Alberta, “you know it’s still
morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t had one so far, have I?” he retorted, ringing,
and stared in oafish surprise when she departed promptly
from the room. “What have I done now, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“You <em>are</em> getting peppered from all directions,” I laughed.
“But cheer up, old man,” I added, hearing a measured tread
in the corridor. “This staff of servants of yours certainly
outdoes the crew of any sinking ship I’ve ever heard of in
devotion to duty. After last night’s catastrophe—well, they
deserve medals, platinum ones.”</p>

<p>Soames slid in and Crofts said, “Whiskey,” cocking an eye
at me to see if I approved.</p>

<p>“Yes, and by the way, Soames,” I called, while the servant
turned on his heel, “just tell us the truth, will you? Why
aren’t you and Morgan and the rest fifty miles away from
here and running for your lives?”</p>

<p>His face was a flat mask, with expression ironed out of
every feature. “I—I beg your pardon, sir? I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do. Come on, man,” I rallied him. “What’s
this hold Blenkinson’s got over you?”</p>

<p>His countenance remained under rigid muscular control, but
his legs gave a little shiver. He looked at me, and his face
was empty of thought, but then his gaze met his master’s. He
paled, for Crofts’ glare demanded rather than invited
confession.</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s Mr. Blenkinson’s, er, theory, sir.”</p>

<p>“My God, has Blenkinson a theory too!” Crofts shouted.
“A speculative butler! What next? I don’t pay him to have
theories.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” agreed Soames. “We all ’ave the greatest
confidence in Mr. Blenkinson.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” I said. “And Soames, ah, what is the nature
of Mr. Blenkinson’s theory?”</p>

<p>The servant had the look of a man ground between
millstones. His neck undulated in a series of gulps.</p>

<p>“Out with it,” I urged. “Confession is good for the soul.”</p>

<p>Soames turned an imploring look at me, his eyes like
those of a wretch <i>in extremis</i>.</p>

<p>“Oh, Blenkinson’s theory be damned,” growled Crofts
impatiently; “but don’t tell him I said so. Fetch the whiskey.”</p>

<p>The servant dashed for the door, and it was Toby who
brought in the decanter and glasses.</p>

<p class="diarydate">It is now 2.30 <span class="meridienne">P.M.</span></p>

<p>An hour ago it was clear and mild; then the mist redoubled
and a chill came into the air, something we have not
experienced before by day.</p>

<p>She has not returned. I shall try to organize a searching
party at once, and if no one else regards the situation
seriously, I’ll go alone to find her.</p>

<h2>XXIV. <br> Bannerlee’s Secret</h2>

<p class="diarydate">2.45 <span class="meridienne">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Salt shared my perturbation. Indeed, he adopted
the idea of a searching expedition with such alacrity and
energy that one might suppose Miss Lebetwood to be fleeing from
justice!</p>

<p>There were some bitter things said of her, though, by
those, even, who volunteered readiest for the search.
Repressed criticisms of her seemingly callous behaviour since
Cosgrove’s death outcropped now. I stood by, a coward, for
hot answers rose to my lips and I suppressed them. I remembered
that from these hostile thoughts, thoughts more sinister
might spring.</p>

<p>Just as they were going, I observed that Maryvale was not
present. (Aire, too, was not among us.) Tenney volunteered
the information, gained from Harmony, that Maryvale has
again locked himself in his room. Seeking admittance in her
morning round of the bedrooms, she found the door fastened
and received a gruff intimation that she need not trouble to
knock again until further notice.</p>

<p>I am almost as unwilling to leave Maryvale to his own
devices as to leave Paula Lebetwood unsought for on the
hills. But we <em>must</em> find her!</p>

<p class="diarydate">7.45 <span class="meridienne">P.M.</span></p>

<p>The last stragglers have not even yet returned from the
uplands.</p>

<p>Hours of starved hope they were, while I stumbled along
the half-blind paths, often bewildered, once quite lost myself.
It was dogged work. I never should have struggled through
without an inexorable motive and the faintest glimmer of
a clue, a clue offered me by Salt many days ago. Had he not
told how in his boyhood he had found “something like” the
oratory of St. Tarw? I had kept the directions he had given,
and now in a forlorn hazard I followed them, since they alone
might lead me to some definite place that she, too, might have
sought.</p>

<p>In observing Salt’s tuition, I was obliged to keep for the
most part below the crown of the hills. The flanks were cut
by gorges where water had eaten its way. In these places I
made but indifferent progress. In a dusky dingle I did no
better, and although I gasped in relief at finding what seemed
a path, it proved unfriendly, for it led me into a covert of
dogwood whose small green berries were turning purple-black,
and deserted me there. I got out somehow, although spines
clutched me. Before me, stretching into the upper fog,
extended a curtain of rock and gravel. I attacked it with feet
and hands.</p>

<p>It seemed to go up and up forever. In that frantic climb,
out of a bottom soon invisible, up to a summit veiled in fog,
I tore a finger-nail and broke into the flesh of my left palm.
I paused on a splintery ledge to bind my handkerchief over
the wound, and rested there awhile. It was then that I
thought of looking, not up or down, but sidewise.</p>

<p>A brief cry escaped me. I could see further on the left,
and what I saw quickened my heart.</p>

<p>A few yards away the rock curtain ended somewhat
abruptly, and beyond appeared a brief slope full of stunted
trees. Even further in the same direction, the trees gave
place to shorter, tangled growth intermixed with grassy patches.
Here and there a monolith thrust up from the surface, which
on the whole was fairly level, though a vague darkness in the
background showed that this clearing was not the summit
of any hill, but a platform more or less below the highest
elevation.</p>

<p>Along the outer edge of the cleared space stood a regiment
of trees, whose ranks were quite dense enough to conceal
what lay behind from eyes in the hollow of the Vale. Having
gained the grassy platform with its curious black stones
sprouting and littered about, I found that while I continued
in the same direction over the tumbled grass full of small
scarlet toadstools, the ground grew higher and the dark mass
of the hilltop closer, while the platform narrowed.</p>

<p>My hope caught fire and blazed. I kept peering ahead and
slightly upward, for the gentle slope persisted. Suddenly I saw
Miss Lebetwood, very dim in the mist.</p>

<p>She was seated close under the shadowy brow of the hill,
with her face away from me, and her head thrown back,
leaning against something.</p>

<p>A lovely picture she had been that first night by the
gate-house tower; now again I paused, rapt by the grace of her
languid, lissome body, by the pale abstraction of her
face—against the ancient gloom of the oratory of St. Tarw!</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt that this had been the
devotional cell of the saint. Here stood the rude arch, still
discernible though one or two of its stones had been
displaced and the rest were mantled in moss and grass grown
downward from above. The projection beside the door, where
her head leaned, had surely once upon a time been the support
of a holy shrine. These scattered rocky benches: on them
had sat the small, dark, half-savage hill-folk, the strange
congregations of the venerable man.</p>

<p>No, I would not rouse her from that mood of thought or
vacancy; I would be still until she turned and looked at me.
So minutes passed, while her image impressed itself in my
mind, in my very heart of hearts. While I stood there in the
grass, awaiting the first movement of her weary head, even
breathing softly that she might not be disturbed, for the first
time I dared to say to myself, bold and unafraid, “I love
her.”</p>

<p>She did quicken from her inanimate pose, she did turn her
head and see me. She rose swiftly; already I had come very
near to her.</p>

<p>When she attempted to speak, her voice faltered. “So—so
you found me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Paula,” I said.</p>

<p>“I was waiting. I heard—”</p>

<p>My own queer voice filled the pause. “You don’t mean
that—you were waiting—for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You heard the others calling, and you waited for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Then—I cannot describe what was, only what must have
been, for the white-heat of those moments has annihilated
the memory of them—she was close within my arms, and my
lips reached hers. Yes, for that ineffable once, I must have
kissed her, since I remember too well that when I would
have drawn her to me again, she put me away with a gentle
pressure of her hand against my arm.</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly, her gaze searching mine.
“You—misunderstood, I think. I—I let you because of what I saw
in your eyes. They were soft and wistful for a moment.”</p>

<p>“But—Paula—”</p>

<p>“Now I think that you must never do that again.”</p>

<p>My mind went cold and grey as the world about us. “I’m
sorry, then. Indeed, I must have misunderstood.”</p>

<p>I saw that some change had rushed over her. Her face became
dull and sad, as if the clammy gloaming that darkened
about us had penetrated to her heart. “Don’t misunderstand
me all over again; please don’t. Your kisses might be very
sweet, and their meaning might be dear to dream about. But
you know that I have to set all the woman in me aside. . . .
I must forget dreams,” she said bitterly, and to my
astonishment she put both hands across her eyes and commenced to
sob, sinking down on the stone seat again. I stood by and felt
the iron grind into my soul.</p>

<p>But half a minute later she looked up with a rueful smile
through her tears. “How perfectly ridiculous of me. What
must you think! Don’t imagine for a minute that I was
crying for any such preposterous reason as I said. It’s just
that I’m awfully, awfully tired, and I <em>felt</em> tired that moment.
I was up nearly all last night over your diary. Please, have
you a handkerchief I can use? I’ve nothing but one of these
silly little women’s affairs.”</p>

<p>I handed over a fairly clean one. “Up all last night and
in the hills all day! You’re a Trojan. But at least you found
what you were looking for?”</p>

<p>She ceased dabbing for a moment to give me a half-moist
look. “Here, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course.”</p>

<p>“I found what I wanted, but it wasn’t here. This was
afterward. I somehow had a feeling that you would come here
and discover me sooner or later. These <em>inane</em> tears.”</p>

<p>I brooded on this for a while, while she removed the last
traces of them. “I suppose it’s no good asking where you
found what you really wanted?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes—up there on Mynydd Tarw.”</p>

<p>“But at least you aren’t bringing it back with you as you
declared you would, are you?”</p>

<p>She gave a strange laugh. “It was too big, a million times
too big. So I have to be satisfied with carrying it here.” She
placed a finger against her forehead. “Now I am ready, sir,
if you’ll take me back down with you. Please let’s go now.
There is so much to be done to-night.”</p>

<p>“You shall rest to-night, nothing else.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary—don’t think I’m rude—there’s
everything else. Yes, yes, really. Come, let’s go.”</p>

<p>She picked up the little campstool, but I took it from her.
Slowly we turned and went away from that place, and while
we passed through a huddling hazel wood where sheep had
made a track before us, the sun at last thridded the mist with
hazy golden beams. While we descended the glen, I looked
at her face with the light playing upon its firm, rounded
surfaces and gleaming in her eyes. She was weary, indeed,
with what seemed more than physical exhaustion; I slipped
my arm about her when she appeared almost unable to pick
her footing on the precarious slope. But, “Oh, no, no,” she said,
resisting so softly that I pitied her, and took my arm away.</p>

<p>When we had discovered the path that led down to Aidenn
Water and were well on our slanting way to the valley
bottom, she found more strength in the smoother footing.
Suddenly I felt that she was scrutinizing me, and I turned my
head to hear her ask:</p>

<p>“What did it remind you of—that place up there?”</p>

<p>“A graveyard,” I answered almost without thought.</p>

<p>“Just so. Tell me honestly; have you never been there
before?”</p>

<p>“Before?—there?” I repeated, quite truly surprised.</p>

<p>“Don’t temporize, please. Confess that you were there
before but didn’t set it down when you wrote your journal.
That was the place where you fell when you escaped from the
bull, and it was where you took shelter from the storm the
day you saw the rainbow. Wasn’t it?” I did not answer but
she insisted. “I suppose you had some foolish fear that if you
wrote about it and someone—like poor me—read of the
discovery before you had published it to the world, you might
lose the credit for it. Yes? For it <em>was</em> your discovery, and I
only followed the hints you gave.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said promptly, since my secret was guessed. “It
was my discovery, and I wanted to preserve it for myself.
I thought I had written enough, without being explicit to
the point of revelation, to sustain any claim I might need to
make afterward. I suppose you think I was a very large and
egregious idiot?”</p>

<p>For a little while she did not answer. When I turned to
look at her, her eyes seemed to dwell not on the present but
on the past, and there was the intention of a smile in her face.
“No; I think you were an—antiquarian. Ah, you scholars!”</p>

<p>“Well, in archæological circles you know—” I broke off.</p>

<p>“Archæological circles seem about as important as ant-hills
to me, just now. One thing, though, I really learned last
night and today—a platitude I never quite believed in.”</p>

<p>“A platitude—and not yet discredited?”</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh. “I mean the one about boxing up
truth. You can hammer down board after board, but the
truth is like smoke: it always finds a new chink in the cover
to escape from. Don’t you see”—she gave a smothered laugh—“the
moment you began keeping your archæological cat in the
bag, you had to use all kinds of devices of wire and rope to
keep it there, and more often than not it was you and not
the cat who was tangled!”</p>

<p>I looked at her in comic dismay. “Well! If you’ve found
that out from the diary you must be a perfect demon of
ratiocination!”</p>

<p>“Hardly; it was obvious. For instance, when Mr. Salt offered
you his suggestions for finding the oratory, you felt
obliged to skid all around the truth that you already knew
where it was. You even said that finding it seemed
‘superfluous.’ That was rather neat, I thought.”</p>

<p>I grinned. “So do I. As a fact, I followed his route to the
oratory to-day. And now I have a gleam in my prophetic
soul that you found discrepancies in the rainbow section of
the diary.”</p>

<p>She weighed her answer. “Well, I don’t know. I saw the
discrepancies readily enough. You never were on Whimble
all that afternoon, were you, in spite of the suggestions you
scattered to that effect? I always thought archæologists were
profound people, but I had no idea they were so sly.”</p>

<p>I mused. “Hm. You are perfectly right. ‘I headed straight
for Whimble. . . .’ ”</p>

<p>“Yes, and afterward, ‘It would take me some time to get
from where I was to the edge of Mynydd Tarw.’ That was
so, no doubt, but I’d bet a—a lot that you were on Mynydd
Tarw all the while.”</p>

<p>“Naturally, but I wasn’t going to say so, when the oratory
was under the edge of that particular hill. Yes, you’re
right: my secret entailed quite a number of peccadilloes.”</p>

<p>I saw her smiling at me. “They became quite inveterate,
didn’t they? But the whole thing goes back to the platitude.
Squeeze the truth in one place and it sticks out in another.
Because you <em>would</em> have the secret of the oratory all to yourself,
you had to conceal the innocent fact that you accidentally
left a book there.”</p>

<p>I stared at her as at a miracle, which indeed she was. “Come,
come; this is on the thick side. You must have been shadowing
me.”</p>

<p>“Only in brain-waves. It was your copy of the Book of
Sylvan Armitage, wasn’t it? How did you happen to leave
it there? I can guess you had it out of your knapsack and
studied it for comparison with the place you had fallen to.
Then, perhaps, you laid it down—”</p>

<p>“I did, and leaned back to rest, just as I found you doing
this afternoon. The Book slipped off the stone and fell inside
the shelter of the oratory. I didn’t notice it when I started
up and left the place. But how on earth did you know?”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t think it was so wonderful for me to see a
plain nose on a plain face. To begin with, I was surprised
to death when I learned that you hadn’t brought your own
copy of the Armitage with you, but had to send for it from
Balzing. Was it likely that you would leave behind the one
work which referred to the oratory of St. Tarw? Then that
evening in the library after the rainbow, some of Lib’s
remarks—‘Having the hump,’ and so forth—sounded as if
you might be concealing something that you had brought with
you under your coat. And finally—well this alone would have
been enough to tell me—the day you were supposed to receive
it through the mail, you didn’t call at the Post Office for it;
when you came home from Old Aidenn, you gave New Aidenn
a wide berth and crossed the Smatcher.”</p>

<p>“Out of my own inkwell I stand condemned,” I laughed.
“It’s uncanny, that’s what it is, the way you get inside my
cranium and read my secret thoughts. Still, you haven’t told
me what the fundamental deduction was. It couldn’t have
been a mere guess. How did you <em>know</em> that I wasn’t on
Whimble when I drew the map?”</p>

<p>“I think you are playing Doctor Watson on purpose. Why,
that was the essence of simplicity. Why, a <em>primitive</em> mind
could have told that. What do you suppose I brought the
campstool for? It was as simple as—as rule of three. You’ll
have to discover that for yourself.”</p>

<p>After silence:</p>

<p>“What was that you said—about the rapture you felt the
first time you wandered on the uplands? You never could feel
the same freedom? You never could be so happy again?”</p>

<p>“I think I never shall.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. I hate this place. It has robbed me of
something—something more than love or any little thing like that.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I asked, appalled—and when she
did not answer, I asked again, with my hand clenched about
her wrist and my eyes burning into her face, “What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure . . . but I suppose I mean . . . innocence.
Since I came here, something has happened that I never can
forget. I think it will make all my life worse.”</p>

<p>We went on. The sunlight was dying. The trees became
spectral. In me, who walked beside this wonderful,
clear-spirited girl, a monstrous horror welled.</p>

<p>I had a sense of vast, dark, insufferable wings hovering
down. Was it fated that I should need to protect her against
herself? Long before we reached the House, that I had sworn
to do, at all costs, whatever should betide.</p>

<h2>XXV. <br> The Flight of Parson Lolly</h2>

<p class="diarynote">(There ended my diary. Thenceforth I was to be like a
man in a maelstrom. And now that circumstances have stayed
my hand from its task for weeks on end, I have no confidence
that I can record with due proportion and emphasis events
which seem to have been fantastic and instantaneous as dreams.
Frantic suspense, frozen horror, and the rest are now a
whirling memory. But I hope, above all else, that whoever reads
these lines may feel, as those who knew her did, the splendid
nervous courage, the shrewd discernment, and the strange
compassion and mercy, of Paula Lebetwood!)</p>

<p>Make no mistake. The weary, faltering girl at my
side—never, never for an instant did I suspect her.</p>

<p>Yet while we lagged through a ruined fairyland, past the
wreck of Sir Pharamond’s first hold, beneath branches where
the rooks were brawling, and between the ordered files of the
summer-house park—all the way my heart grew blacker, and
the incubus weighed heavier on my soul. I feared for her, and
fear pressed cold fingers against my lips.</p>

<p>Blasphemous thoughts; they were not mine. I had no
thoughts of her but reverence.</p>

<p>They might have been the jangling voices of the birds
themselves: “Look! Here comes the foreign woman who was
pledged to the Kingmaker, but is going to marry his millions
instead! Why has she never wept a tear for the man in his
shroud?” What if the trees had voices, these grey and sombre
sycamores? “We saw what happened in the two twilights. We
know where the golden-haired girl was when Cosgrove met his
fate. We know when she left the strawberry grove the day
that Heatheringham rushed toward death. We saw her slip
across the shadowed lawn—”</p>

<p>No, no! If trees could speak, they would declare her
innocence.</p>

<p>Not trees but men would be her judges, cunning men, who
might weave about her a web of suspicion with strands as fine
and strong as silk.</p>

<p>Scotland Yard might be waiting for us when we returned;
that is, a brisk, clear-headed, observant, utterly unprejudiced
investigator, a person whose mind as nearly as might be
resembled an inductive and deductive machine. He would sweep
the ground clear of the débris of false starts and idle
speculations, and construct anew.</p>

<p>The deaths: what would the lynx of justice discover immediately
in respect of them? He would hear of a motive, money.
How should he know better than to impute a sordid impulse to
this high-minded girl? He would hear of a quarrel on the
afternoon of Cosgrove’s death. How should he know that there
had been more than mere anger in her mood when she parted
from us, that there had been dignity, aloofness, a temper far
above reprisal?</p>

<p>But there was worse, much worse. She may have been with
Cosgrove the moment he was struck down!</p>

<p>Belvoir, coming toward the towers, had seen the Irishman
with canvas lifted regarding the puny battle-axe. In the
mixed light, Belvoir had not been positive he <em>had</em> seen Cosgrove,
but the likelihood was that he had attested to less rather
than more than the truth. The American girl might have
been beyond the Irishman at that moment, concealed partly
by his bulk, partly by the darkness of her gown in the twilight.
I, of course, had come past the spot afterward and found the
lawn empty, but the two might easily have gone through one
of the entrances of the House and re-emerged shortly after I
had made my reconnaissance from the parapet. What brief,
passionate scene could then have taken place, such as would
have ended by Cosgrove’s turning away and her hammering
him with a rough-and-ready chunk of rock snatched up from
the rim of the flower-bed, I left to the professional imagination.</p>

<p>In Heatheringham’s death, we knew her insistence that she
had disobeyed his bidding, and her declaration of what she had
seen. But, again, there was not a tittle of proof of her assertion
that she had remained on the edge of the strawberry trees.
Quite safely she could have slipped back into the House.
I wondered, in spite of the arm thrust through the glass, if the
detective might not have been outside the House when he
pressed the trigger, and that straightway he rushed into the Hall
(pursuing something?)—to meet his death. Who waited for
him there? No one could have, save Paula Lebetwood.</p>

<p>Black—it was black.</p>

<p>I tried to gain comfort from the obscurities that would
confront Scotland Yard if he tried to build up a theory in this
wise. I recalled the bone, the laugh, the pig’s gore, and other
unsolved conundrums. But Scotland Yard, being an experienced
hand, would be sure to fit them in somewhere. I was
sick at heart.</p>

<p>Yes, I must protect her against the world, and, if need be,
against herself. The proof would be in action. I began
wondering whom I could trust.</p>

<p>When we came to the fringe of the sycamore park and
passed alongside the cypress trees, one first-storey window
showed light in the northern wall of the House, and we could
see radiance from others down the long façade.</p>

<p>“Miss Mertoun has returned.” It was the only speech either
of us had offered in two dark and desolate miles.</p>

<p>“Millicent?” The American girl halted in surprise. “Did
they make her go out, too?”</p>

<p>“She volunteered like the rest of the ladies for searching
in the Vale itself.”</p>

<p>“Darling Millicent. I love her better than anything else on
earth. She shouldn’t have tried to find me, Mr. Bannerlee.
She isn’t strong, you know, and this has been a terrible,
tragic week for her. She should never have come to Aidenn
Vale, but I didn’t—understand then, as I do now.”</p>

<p>Somehow we did not go straight on, but lingered there by
the cypresses with their low-hung darkness.</p>

<p>“But her week has not been as tragic as yours.”</p>

<p>Her voice was sombre. “More, much more.”</p>

<p>“What!” I came closer, peered into her face, where the
dusk had erected shadows. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t wondered, I see, about Millicent and Sean.”</p>

<p>“Wondered? Wondered what, in God’s name?”</p>

<p>She spoke wearily. “You didn’t know Sean, of course.
Neither did I, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I cried again, with an intolerable
heaviness in me, remembering Lib.</p>

<p>“Religion and sensuality: they go together often, don’t they?
I thought that if I recognized that—streak in Sean I might
disregard it and it would be like a thing that never was. If
that had been all. . . .”</p>

<p>I caught up the silence. “You can never make me
believe—that Miss Mertoun—”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course not. She wasn’t like the others. . . . She
hasn’t offended me; I’m the offender. . . .”</p>

<p>“Paula, you mustn’t stop. Tell me what you mean.”</p>

<p>“It’s beastly of me, I suppose . . . especially when someone
else . . . I wonder why it is we confide in people we half-know
instead of our closest friends. But it’s horrible to have a
thing pent up in your brain . . . like a deadly growth.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Paula.”</p>

<p>“If I hadn’t come along, Millicent would be Mrs. Cosgrove
now. It sounds—almost grotesque, doesn’t it? But there
it was, a fact that months and even years couldn’t kill. I
never had the least inkling of it—oh, Millicent’s been a loyal
friend to me—until we were all here and it was—too late.
Millicent came, you see, since if she didn’t—I would never
have had a Bidding Feast without Millicent, and she knew it.
But I never guessed . . . until she told me, after midnight,
the night you came.”</p>

<p>“She—loved him still?”</p>

<p>“No, hated him then. But the old heart-wound would break
out during sleep. His music, as she called it, came to her
through her dreams. Then she answered what she believed to
be—his call.”</p>

<p>A little wind came winding down the Vale and wrapped
its chilly arm about us. She said, very low: “That was what
I meant, partly, when I spoke of lost innocence a little while
ago. I have changed toward people since I came here. I think
I can never trust a person again.” Then quickly, “We must
go in. They’ll be wanting to know I’m safe.”</p>

<p>I followed where she made a road through the darkness.</p>

<p>We reached the House at seven-fifteen. At the bottom of
the stairs she turned. “Thank you—thank you more than I
can say. May I have the campstool? I must go up now, really.
I—I—have to—think over to-night.”</p>

<p>I handed over the stool. “If ever—” I commenced, feeling
my voice shake in my throat.</p>

<p>The boy Toby, his hair all on end as usual, crossed the
corridor from the dinner-room to the Hall. She called his name,
and the lad reappeared, coming toward us bashfully. His eyes,
turned on her, were filled with something like awe, and I
remembered how she had made this seemingly lumpish lad her
excellent and devoted scholar. He now carried a few yards
of insulated wire.</p>

<p>“Has Superintendent Salt returned?”</p>

<p>“Yes, from the hills, Miss. He came back early, but he’s
gone away again.”</p>

<p>“Did he leave any message?”</p>

<p>“He said you wasn’t to mind if he didn’t bring his friend
from—somewhere—”</p>

<p>“Scotland Yard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right. He wouldn’t bring him to-night. He said
you was to go ahead anyhow because the French womenfolks
was coming with Constable Pritchard.”</p>

<p>“French women!” I exclaimed in surprise and pleasure.
“Does he mean that the sisters Delambre have been brought
back?”</p>

<p>“Sure to be,” said Toby.</p>

<p>“By George, I’ll be tickled to see what they look like. But
what does it all mean? No one could imagine—”</p>

<p>Miss Lebetwood silenced me with a gesture and an eager
question. “He was working here this afternoon, then, wasn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss, but it was a secret or somefing. He put the
maids out of the house at half-past three.”</p>

<p>“Three-thirty!” I exclaimed again, indignantly now. “He
didn’t waste much of his precious time in the search!” I asked
the lad, “Why did he make the women-servants leave the
building? He did, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; he was going to use some gas from a little tank
he had with him all over the ground floor of the House. He
said it was a deadly poisonous gas, and unless they were
looking for their deaths if they got a whiff they had better go
down to New Aidenn for the rest of the afternoon. Wheeler
was in the search; so I drove ’em all down to the bridge in the
big car,” Toby recited with pride.</p>

<p>“And did you come back for a whiff?” asked Miss
Lebetwood, smiling faintly.</p>

<p>“No, Miss; I went to my workroom in the stables and did
some more on my radio. I only remembered about a quarter
past six that I had to fix the lights in the Hall, and when I
came to the House I met Mr. Salt and the constable’s brother
that wasn’t here before coming out with the gas tank. ‘It’s all
right,’ he said. ‘Tell ’em they can go anywhere they like
now. I’ve sucked the gas back into the respirator; so there’s
no danger for that matter of fact.’ And then he told me what
I told you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose most of our people have returned?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss. The ladies are all upstairs or somewhere.
There’s them back from New Aidenn, too, and Mr. Blenkinson
and some of the others from the hills. If you wasn’t found
by nine o’clock, they was going to ’phone up Penybont and
Bleddfa and maybe get a bloodhound and have a grand search
like they almost had for Sir Brooke Mortimer.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Toby,” said the girl, “and thank you again,
Mr. Bannerlee. I <em>shall</em> have to do a bit of thinking now.” She
went quickly, almost lightly, up the steps. Somehow, she had
drawn comfort from Salt’s strange behaviour.</p>

<p>I followed Toby into the Hall. Quite by chance I had
found the person I could trust, one whose allegiance to the
American girl might be as great as mine.</p>

<p>He was upon a lofty step-ladder planted beneath the chandelier
which hung some distance clear of the musicians’ gallery.
Below him rested a bushel basket partly filled with electric
bulbs.</p>

<p>“Will you be there long, Toby?”</p>

<p>“Only to take out the rest of the bulbs, sir, and connect
a bit of wire with the wall-fixture in case they needs it. Only
a minute or two, sir.”</p>

<p>I drew close to the foot of the ladder and spoke very softly.
“Toby—can you get an hour off before very late
to-night—to do something for Miss Lebetwood?”</p>

<p>“For Miss Paula?” His funny hair seemed to be a forest
of notes of exclamation. “Of <em>course</em> I can, sir, for Miss Paula.”</p>

<p>“Right! I knew you would. Come down here a minute, and
I’ll give you directions. This is very secret, mind. If you should
meet even Miss Paula herself, remember you’re not to show
a sign you’re the wiser.”</p>

<p>I laid the trappings of mystery on very thick, enough to
make the souls of a dozen lads lick their lips. I explained how
a message might be delivered at the House later on to-night
that would make it necessary for Miss Lebetwood, and perhaps
Miss Mertoun, to leave without word or warning to anyone
by the eleven o’clock train. Secrecy and haste were the points
I stressed. He fell into the plot with so much spirit that I felt
a little ashamed of the deception I was practising. With
eagerness that ran before my suggestions, he promised to be at New
Aidenn station when it opened for the 9.40 train, and to
purchase with money I gave him two tickets for London available
by the late express. He would leave the tickets for me <em>in the
mail</em>. We went into the armoury and agreed on a definite
spot. He would also secrete two ladies’ bicycles, property of
the Clays, beneath the bush opposite the third oak tree on the
left-hand side of the drive after passing the gate-house. We
went over that complex direction again and again.</p>

<p>Yes, in these days of the many-tentacled police, the
telegraph, and the radio, I was planning for Paula Lebetwood
an escape by flight. With two hours’ clear start, for I would
see that the telephone did not function and that the shaky
bridge should go down behind the pursued, I could almost
guarantee scot-freedom. For of course those tickets would not
be used for getting to London, not when the express connected
at Leominster with fast trains running both north and
south. To what destination I would direct the fugitives, I
had better not say, but it was one which would afford a refuge
almost before the wires were singing with the alarm for her
capture.</p>

<p>At that moment Aire slipped in from the darkness through
one of the french windows. His head was bare, his clothing
was somewhat dishevelled, and he seemed to lack for breath.
His mouth was set, with its thin blue-whitish lips drawn
back from the teeth. He stared at us some time before speaking;
then his voice, the first time I had known it to be so, was
instinct with fear.</p>

<p>“Bannerlee, seen Maryvale?”</p>

<p>“I’ve just returned with Miss Lebetwood. What makes you
ask?”</p>

<p>“He’s—gone.”</p>

<p>“He’ll come back.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he will. Come in here, Bannerlee.”</p>

<p>Quite astonished by his tone, I followed him toward the
library, turning at the door to give a pithy glance at the
boy, whose hair now looked like a forest of query-notes. When
I entered the library, Aire had thrown himself down in one of
the big leather arm-chairs in a posture of complete relaxation,
and was breathing heavily. Again it was some time before
he spoke.</p>

<p>“He’s gone, God knows where. He left me an hour ago
while we were walking among the strawberry trees. Went
snap off, like breaking a stick, while I was in the middle of
a sentence.”</p>

<p>“Why, Doctor,” I exclaimed, with a snort of assumed
cheerfulness, “surely you’re making too much of this.”</p>

<p>He sprang up, paced the breadth of the room, ugly wrinkles
on his brow. “I hope I am. I hope I am. But I’ve bitched
the thing so. And this afternoon he seemed in perfect possession
of himself. I’ve been so damned optimistic that now the
reverse— He seemed perfectly normal late this afternoon, you
understand; in fact the two of us were planning—no matter.
I must go out again.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come along with you.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I’ll have to manage him alone. It will be
‘Horse and Hattock in the Devil’s name,’ and I fancy I’m
the only one who can play up to him.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll be in danger.”</p>

<p>He gave a short laugh. “I think not. I’m more afraid of
the things that can’t hurt.” He looked out to the lawn. “Thank
God for a clear night, and moonlight. You know, the trees
seem to have faces in their trunks; they seem to be grinning
and mowing in the wind. That’s the sort of drivel this thing’s
brought me to. Well, I’m off.”</p>

<p>He made toward the door, but paused with his hand on it.
“Don’t say a word of this to anyone, Bannerlee. I’ll need a
free hand if I’m to bring it off. Cheerio.”</p>

<p>He plunged into the night. I saw him cross the silver carpet
of the lawn and disappear between the gigantic jaws of the
gate-house towers.</p>

<p>A moment later in the corridor I met Harmony carrying
a tray up to “the young ladies.” She told me that cold viands
were laid out in the dinner-room for those lagging in from
the hills. But in spite of my three hours’ struggle, I was in
no humour for feeding, especially since I was bound to
encounter the others and would have to repeat my adventures
again and again.</p>

<p>I asked the girl if there had been any fresh development
during my absence.</p>

<p>“Did you hear about what they dug up this afternoon, sir?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! You don’t mean another corpse?”</p>

<p>“Lor’, no, sir, not human. In the garden, it was, where the
dogs were scratching the place to pieces. Someone said get a
spade and dig and see what’s there, and they found it.”</p>

<p>“What did they find?”</p>

<p>“A little pig, sir. And it was wrapped in some black cloth
they said must be Parson Lolly’s gown, only it was all tore
up and full of holes and had some funny bits of red paper
pinned to it. They do say that Parson Lolly is too tall for
a gown like that. We met Superintendent Salt when we were
coming back from the town, and he was carrying it with him.”</p>

<p>“So,” I remarked. “It looks to me as if the Superintendent
took advantage of Miss Lebetwood’s absence to spend a busy
afternoon down here.”</p>

<p>“Lor’, yes, sir. He was using the gas-expirator and fair
drove us out of the house.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad he made such a thorough job of inspirating the
gas again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, or it wouldn’t be safe. It’s that wonderful, sir.”</p>

<p>“It is,” I agreed heartily, and cursed—to myself.</p>

<p>She with her tray went down the passage while I went up
the second flight, feeling not the shadow of a suspicion of my
darling, but the certainty that before the night was past, she
would be accused. I hurried past Maryvale’s portal with an
aching heart.</p>

<p>Yet such was the settled habit of the week that when I
reached my own door, the turmoil of my mind was stilled.
This lonely chamber, which had such baneful associations
for me a week ago, had become a harbour of refuge. Whatever
strife and doom might wait outside, here the ceiling
aslope, the candle-bracket askew, the oaken chest, and the
narrow window before my table invited me to my work.</p>

<p>I fell to. I wrote steadily. I forgot to be hungry. Once the
sound of a gong quivered through the House, but not until
long after it had died away did I consider what it meant.
Then I set down my pen. Mrs. Belvoir’s séance must be in
progress, and Scotland Yard was doubtless there. I must
attend.</p>

<p>I secured my invaluable pocket light before setting out.
Past Maryvale’s door forbid, down the long stairs, through the
corridor of faces—until a murmurous voice reached me from
the Hall of the Moth, a voice whose tone I recognized though
the words were indistinct. Yes, Mrs. Belvoir was probing
beyond the visible.</p>

<p>Softly I opened the door behind the musicians’ stair,
tiptoed over the threshold, and stood concealed within. Great
curtains shut out the moonlight from the Hall, which was
dark indeed, save for the circle of bulbs on the circumference
of the chandelier. These, cased by Toby in paper, gave very
little illumination, and that of a mysterious tinge. At the
other end of the room wavered a lazy fire, composed for the
most part of bluish flame.</p>

<p>The people seated around the table, which had been placed
not far from the musicians’ stairs, were so vague that I could
not tell their attitude toward the proceedings. I observed at
once that Mrs. Belvoir was not going to “bring the spirits and
all,” not yet, at any rate. For on the table was spread some
dark cloth above which I caught the faint glimmer of glass:
a crystal sphere. The woman seated deep in her chair before
the ball must be the pythoness herself.</p>

<p>Her voice had lapsed when I entered, and a long silence ensued.
Then she said: “It’s no use. I’ve lost it again,” and I saw
a white arm reach up. Instantly a dazzling light shone above
her head, from a special globe connected with the wall-fixture,
and Mrs. Belvoir was gazing intently into the crystal
ball. I now saw that the sphere was erected on a small tripod
with legs of different-coloured metals, and that this structure
stood upon a square yellow velvet cloth laid over a cloth of
blue. A mouldy, triangular crust of bread was placed
underneath the crystal, and some statement I had once heard or
read, that “bread possesses a potent protective magic against
evil forces,” occurred to me to explain its presence.</p>

<p>Neither Salt nor any stranger was there. Mrs. Belvoir,
attired in pale mauve ninon, a heliotrope band above her
forehead, and an amethyst pin at her breast, was brooding over
the crystal with eyes that widened and narrowed with the
phase of her thought. Those pale sapphire eyes were darkened
with intensity, and the customary indistinctness of her
face—a mermaid-under-water look—was quite gone. Sometimes her
hands clasped or slid about the sphere; sometimes her fingers
rested on her temples or tapped them gently. Beyond a doubt,
she was sincere.</p>

<p>The assisting parties were either slightly embarrassed or
strongly impressed, all save Belvoir, who sat opposite her;
on his face lived a smile of scepticism. Up went the arm and
the Hall was dim once more.</p>

<p>“I have it now,” said the seeress: “I am in fog, deep fog.”</p>

<p>“Good,” came a <i>sotto voce</i> from the other end of the table,
but the word was drowned in the current of her speech. Leaning
back, but apparently still gazing at the sphere, in trance-life
passivity, she seemed not so much to utter words as to
let the words flow from her mouth.</p>

<p>“I am in fog, thick fog; it clings about me.” Her hands
made dim outward movements, as if pressing away the mist
that enveloped her. “I am lost, and there is a malignant spirit
nearby, but I am not sure I know that—yet. I sit down—on
a rock. I am not very hungry, but since there is nothing else
to do, I eat what I have brought with me. I wait for light
to penetrate the fog. I wish to find something; perhaps I
fear the malignant spirit that is near. I wish to find the
ancient hermit’s cell. It is a place hallowed by good works and
piety. The malignant spirit will not dare come near me there.
I eat and wait. The mist clears partly away at last. I go
on. The sun shines on me; I am glorified. . . .”</p>

<p>I suddenly realized it was my story she told. There was
nothing wonderful in this, to be sure, for the narrative of my
afternoon on the hills had long been common property. I
listened with care, to see if she included some detail proving
her version to be a brain-picture really evoked by the crystal
and having objective authority. But all she added to the fable
was the “malignant spirit” hovering near me all the while,
a presence which I certainly had no idea was dogging me on
the hilltops.</p>

<p>It became apparent that the seeress was not interested in me
but in the spirit, and some time before the dénouement I had
an inkling of how the story would end.</p>

<p>“I am fleeing from the malignant spirit in its carnal shape.
I allow it to overtake me—so far, no farther. We are
approaching the brink of the cliff. I leap aside, and the animal
plunges into the gulf. I am saved, and I hear the carnal
shape of the spirit go thundering down, down, down. I am
saved, and the bull is dead.”</p>

<p>Silence. . . . When Mrs. Belvoir spoke again, her voice
had lost its dreaminess and become positive. But she spoke
with effort; the phrases seemed wrung out of her.</p>

<p>“The bull is dead. . . . But spiritual force . . . is never
destroyed. . . . The bull is dead. . . . The malignant spirit
is living still. . . . It never ceases to operate. . . . It is
localized. . . .”</p>

<p>A small sound shattered the tension of that moment: merely
the opening of one of the french windows.</p>

<p>“My God, what’s that?” cried Eve Bartholomew, before
someone reached above Mrs. Belvoir’s head and lit the bright
globe once more. Mrs. Belvoir turned, intending angry
remonstrance, but her voice was stilled by one look at Doctor
Aire.</p>

<p>He was coatless and collarless, and his shirt and trousers
were miry. His small yellow head seemed to have turned
almost white, save for a ragged cut across his forehead, and
while he spoke the man leaned hard on the back of the <i>Brocade
de Lyons</i> couch as if in the last throes of exhaustion.</p>

<p>Everyone was standing up; my presence excited no surprise.</p>

<p>“Maryvale’s—somewhere near.”</p>

<p>“Doctor! What’s happened to you?” cried Crofts.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a bout with him on the tennis court. He was a
few stone too heavy for me. I saw him heading for the
House—probably wants something that’s in his room. I’m
afraid—he’s insane.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do, then?” asked Crofts, become very cool
in the crisis.</p>

<p>“Keep a watch at every entrance, enough of us at each place
to tackle him safely.”</p>

<p>“Stephen, you mustn’t go out again. You’ve done too much
already,” said Alberta.</p>

<p>But Aire, though he swayed, hung on grittily, and shook
his head. “No, thanks. A stiff drink will put me right. Just have
the men-servants in here, Crofts, and—”</p>

<p>Miss Mertoun gave a shrill scream. A creature was looking
at us through the open entrance behind Aire—a strange
creature.</p>

<p>The thing that looked at us was using Maryvale’s face, but
it was not Maryvale any longer. The countenance, blank of
any jot of humanity, had become a mere bag with features. It
lingered there only for a moment, staring at us with
incomprehension so complete that a pang of pity thrilled through
me. A woman sobbed. The face was gone.</p>

<p>Pell-mell the men were gone, too, in a wild chase scattering
across the lawn, and I among them. Yet sorry as I was for
Maryvale, he did not concern me now. I had sterner work
even than trammelling a moonlight madman.</p>

<p>I determined to risk the notice of my absence in order to
make certain that the bicycles were properly waiting where
Toby had promised to conceal them. Keeping under the shadow
of trees where I could, I hastened across the southern lawn
toward the oaks that guard the drive below the gate-house
towers. I was just in time to see someone drag one of the
bicycles from its bushy covert into the full moonlight and
bend over the front tyre with a gleaming blade ready to slash.
I sprang upon this man, mastered him more by the surprise of
my leap than by main strength. He fell face upward,
groaning. His knife lay on the grass ten feet away.</p>

<p>“Morgan! What crazy work is this?”</p>

<p>He thrashed about in my inexorable grip, and blurted out
his words in speech that reverted toward the primitive. “The
killers, the killers! They bikes was for them. I saw the lad
fetch ’em and hide ’em, aye I did. ’E’s sweet on ’er since she
took notice of ’im.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” I blustered. “What do you
know about the murderers?”</p>

<p>He struggled to rise, but I let my weight bear down, and he
relapsed with another groan, though certainly not hurt. “I
know who did the killin’. I’ve known all along.”</p>

<p>I shook him roughly by the shoulders. “Don’t lie to me.
Come, out with it, now, or I’ll throttle you.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Blenkinson told us. It’s the sure truth.”</p>

<p>“<em>Blenkinson!</em>” I bawled. “By God, Blenkinson’s got something
to answer for to me. What lies has he been spreading?”</p>

<p>“He has the proofs. It’s sure as if ’e saw ’em with ’is own
eyes.”</p>

<p>“Saw <em>what</em>? Saw <em>who</em>?”</p>

<p>“Saw the killin’s. The three Americans did ’em, and they’ll
make shares of Mr. Cosgrove’s money.”</p>

<p>My fingers itched for his throat, but black fear blazed in
my heart. “Liar!” I screamed. “They’ll hang you sooner
than <em>her</em>! Don’t you know she won’t touch a penny of it until the
killer’s found!”</p>

<p>The man on the ground maintained a sullen obstinacy.
“Sometimes them hangs as isn’t guilty, and them suffers as
finds out. The milkman knew it was ’er, and look what
’appened to ’im.”</p>

<p>“You poor, blind fool,” I exclaimed bitterly. “There’s
jealousy and hatred in this somewhere. Damn Blenkinson. Why,
there isn’t a particle of evidence—”</p>

<p>“There is, there is,” he gasped. “There’s court evidence to
’ang ’er when Mr. Blenkinson comes out with it.”</p>

<p>“What evidence? Tell me!”</p>

<p>He writhed in my clutch. “The beetle-stone as she lost from
’er ring that day. She tried to keep it secret, but it got about.
Mr. Blenkinson found it right in the same place as the stone
she did the killin’ with. There wasn’t a foot between ’em.”</p>

<p>I pressed my fists against his chest, with a downward thrust
now and then for emphasis. “Your fine Blenkinson’s a liar, do
you hear? His evidence, as you call it, isn’t worth a pin. And
if he whispers a word of his slander, and it comes to my ears,
I’ll thrash him within an inch of his life, do you hear? And
the same applies to you—you contemptible—”</p>

<p>I stood up quickly. Men were crowding out of the plantation
near Whimble-foot and clamouring toward the House.
Had the quarry turned? I must be present now at any cost.</p>

<p>This man was cowed sufficiently. He still lay supine; I
prodded him with my foot. “Remember!” I warned him darkly,
and commenced running toward the mansion, stooping to seize
the knife where it glittered on the turf.</p>

<p>Once only I paused for a moment and looked back. Was
there something—someone—moving stealthily toward the man,
who was sitting up now and feeling himself for bruises? A
moment later the figure of a woman emerged from the shadows,
crossed quickly to Morgan, and seemed to lift him bodily from
the ground. I did not immediately grasp that she had lugged
him up by the ear. Now they were arguing, gesticulating, and
though I had heard it seldom, I knew the prim voice of Miss
Ardelia Lacy.</p>

<p>Smiling to myself, I pressed on.</p>

<p>The half-dozen men who reached the corner of the House
more or less in a pack were in the nick of time to see the
wretched Maryvale, driven from cover to cover like a hunted
beast, drag his body, which had never before seemed ponderous,
to the base of one of the gate-house towers. He carried
what seemed a club with an enormous broadened head.</p>

<p>He turned there at bay while we closed in upon him, and
the awful wreck of his face with its glaring eyes and bared
teeth in the moonlight will haunt me to my death. He was a
beast. While we stood speechless, he began to climb.</p>

<p>One hand gripped the queer-looking club, but grasping the
ivy with one hand alone, he raised himself steadily. It was
agony to watch this man-turned-ape mounting where none of us
dared to follow. In the thick wavering growth that clung to
the tower sometimes he swung pendulum-wise, sometimes was
almost buried in the foliage, but his ascent was sure as if he
climbed the stairs within. We cried out to him appeals and
abuse; I do not think he heard us. Someone ran to the stables,
shouting for a ladder.</p>

<p>Maryvale reached the angle where the covered bridge meets
the wall of the tower. Here the ivy thins, and the man made a
wide stop to the roof of the bridge. Then, surely, I felt the
supreme horror, when Maryvale, using the base of a window-slit
for foot-rest, lifted himself over the edge of the turret-roof
and carefully but expeditiously crawled up the slope of
stone toward the pointed top.</p>

<p>We held on shouting, some of us, in sheer desperation.
Pendleton made a frenzied effort to climb the ivy, failed.
Maryvale crept on, his whole body flat against the roof, save for
the arm which held the club-like mass. He reached the pinnacle
and lifted himself to a precarious standing posture, one
foot firm on the very apex, the side of the other foot pressed
against the slope.</p>

<p>For a few moments he bent over the object he had carried;
then when he straightened his body, his arm above his head
brandished a flaming, sizzling torch, and he uttered the only
words I had heard him speak that day. He called out to the
night at large:</p>

<p>“Lolly, Lolly, Parson Lolly!” His voice gloated above the hiss
of the torch. “Who’s the Parson? I’M THE PARSON! AND
NOW I’M GOING OVER THE HILLS: PARSON
LOLLY FLIES!”</p>

<p>The torchlight danced in his face while he laughed shrilly.
Then he launched himself into the air in an enormous leap.</p>

<p>He fell almost but not quite clear of the sloping roof. Striking
it all awry, he dashed against the roof of the bridge and
on down. Mercifully, he was hurled toward the wall of the
tower, and his foot caught for a second in some loop of the
ivy-twine twenty feet from the ground. His swinging body struck
the wall a terrific blow, and he hung head downward for a
moment; his torch, which had drawn a flaming mark across
the night, now blazed upward enveloping him with its flames.
Only for an instant, however. The impact of the collision with
the wall had stunned him, and the torch fell from his hand.
The ivy gave way, and the madman, part of his clothing afire,
fell insensible to the ground at our feet.</p>

<h2>XXVI. <br> Blood on the Portrait</h2>

<p>We had carried Maryvale down to the bridge, and
the ambulance from the Cottage Hospital at Kington had been
waiting to take the unfortunate man away. We did not know
until later, of course, that Maryvale would never walk again,
though the delusion which had unhinged his mind no longer
held him in thrall.</p>

<p>Now we were returning to the House, I and the remnant
of the men of the Bidding Feast. We were a straggling squad.
The sense of Fate, of dark wings closing down, of stern gates
clashing, swept over me again while I wondered which of us
would be the next to suffer. One by one our little group
reassembled in the library. There the women were waiting; there,
too, stood Maryvale’s picture of the headless Parson, more
enigmatic than before. Yes, even with the madman’s words
ringing in our ears, none of us could believe that he had
indeed been the arch-lord of disorder who may have destroyed
two men.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belvoir, purpureal priestess, was making agitated
efforts to reassemble her devotees that she might reveal the
further activities of the “malignant spirit”; but the devotees
were very slippery. Indeed, it was natural that after the
catastrophe of Maryvale, other things should disintegrate, and
although the terror spread through the House tightened the
little knot of us, soon we might have wandered off to bed,
unless a sudden loud knocking had been audible.</p>

<p>“The front door, isn’t it?” asked Miss Lebetwood.</p>

<p>Our host said it was, and added he wondered what the
devil—</p>

<p>“It is a sign for me, I think.” Addressing Mrs. Belvoir:
“Marvel, you must let me take charge now.”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?” demanded the seeress.</p>

<p>“We shall see in a moment.”</p>

<p>Alberta’s firm hand had restrained Crofts from jumping
into the corridor to answer the knock himself. Presently
Soames sidled into the room with a salver which he presented to
Miss Lebetwood. Regarding him closely, I thought he gave
her a slanting, snake-like look of mingled fear and malevolence—and
yet on the surface his countenance remained perfectly
respectful.</p>

<p>“A telegram for you, Miss.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Lib gurgled, “Why, Paula, someone’s had the cheek to
open it!”</p>

<p>“I know,” answered Miss Lebetwood, withdrawing two
closely-filled sheets from the envelope already slit. “Those were
my instructions.”</p>

<p>Crofts asked sharply, “Don’t they know those should be
’phoned here?”</p>

<p>“My directions again,” said the American girl evenly, without
glancing up from the sheet in her hand. Her brief,
self-possessed words made us realize of a sudden that she had
assumed leadership quietly and confidently. “There will be no
answer, Soames,” she remarked, and the man slid out
shadow-wise.</p>

<p>A silence supervened, while we stared at her and she read
the message to the very end. When she was through, her
clear blue eyes were bright with exultation.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s what I expected! I think, people, that we will see
the end of our ghastly bewilderment to-night. Won’t you be
glad? Oh, I will!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Belvoir, aware that she was likely to lose the post of
cynosure, countered vaguely. “What do you mean?” she
repeated. “I haven’t finished—”</p>

<p>“You won’t need to, Marvel dear. I have found a better
way to deal with the malignant spirit you spoke of. I have
Mr. Salt’s approval for what I do. In fact”—she smiled
slightly—“I am his deputy.”</p>

<p>Lord Ludlow’s eyebrows gave a jerk. “His deputy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I believe I am to have a Police-Constable to
enforce my authority. And the—the Frenchwomen from the farm,
the Delambres, have kindly consented to be present here
to-night as witnesses.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be damned,” said Crofts. “Will people be
coming in here all night? Who owns this place, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Alberta struck a counter-blow. “Of course, Paula dearest,
we shall do anything you like. Shall we have to wait long for
those queer old women?”</p>

<p>“<em>They</em> are waiting for <em>you</em>,” said the American girl, standing
by the door which led through the armoury into the Hall.
“Will you enter, please, and take your seats as before?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like this,” objected Crofts, blocking our way. “In
my opinion there should be no jiggery-pokery without Salt or
this Scotland Yard man he was supposed to bring. Why doesn’t
he do as he intended?”</p>

<p>“Hush, dear,” said Alberta, “or Paula will have her
Constable arrest you and lock you up in the gate-house.”</p>

<p>“He may appear later on, of course,” the American girl
suggested, not very hopefully. “You can trust me, though,
to—”</p>

<p>“Later? Later?” Crofts grumbled. “Are we going to be
kept up all night?”</p>

<p>But now Paula Lebetwood ignored him. “Please follow me,”
she said, brushing past, and Crofts gave way.</p>

<p>Like creatures under a spell we moved into the Hall, a place
still obscured from the moon and illumined now only by the
pale ring of lights from the chandelier by the gallery. I offered
to switch on the other chandelier, which hung near the chimney-piece,
but she said she wished it to remain dark for the present.
While she spoke, she lit the one bright globe beneath which
Mrs. Belvoir had sat, and took her own place beneath it.</p>

<p>“Please interrupt me as little as possible,” she requested,
“especially in this early part where I know my way. I’ll try not
to waste time, though I don’t expect this to be a really short
meeting. No, don’t say anything, yet.”</p>

<p>It was hard to repress some exclamation of wonder when I
saw the two women who sat in semi-darkness near the great
expanse of the chimney-piece. Very quiet they had been, and
took no notice of us while we entered. They seemed to be
absorbed in the embers of the fire, from which only an occasional
blue flame winked like an eye. One of them, the squatter of
the two, seemed particularly aloof, and only her flattish nose
and broad forehead peeped beyond the queer old-fashioned hood
still drawn over her head. The other, who wore an expansive
coverchief, was taller and more stalwart, with a strong face,
large chin, and eyes which shone even in the gloom. She
appeared from time to time to take some interest in us and our
proceedings. But on the whole the presence of these foreign
sisters was eerie and evasive.</p>

<p>More stolid than either of these appeared the bovine
Constable who sat near them and seemed to have them in charge.</p>

<p>“Geewhilikins!” emitted Bob, and the state of Lib could
be imagined from the fact that she brazenly allowed him to
clutch her hand and keep it.</p>

<p>Paula Lebetwood indicated the sisters Delambre with a
gesture. “These—gentlewomen: you know who they are, of
course. Before to-night is over we shall all be grateful to them
for coming here. But it’s late, I know, and you are all anxious
to hear my—revelation; so I’ll commence at once.”</p>

<p>Her revelation! God grant that no prank of fate should
cause <em>her</em> to be snared in whatever trap she was setting!</p>

<p>“Don’t think, please, that I am certain myself what to-night’s
result is going to be,” she went on while we settled
into our seats around the shadowy board. “If I did, I wouldn’t
waste your time. But I think—yes, I am almost certain—that
you will find out before you leave your places. And perhaps I
had better put this in evidence first.”</p>

<p>She picked up the creased sheets of the telegram which lay
on the table before her and handed them to Charlton Oxford.
“It’s the answer to a wire Mr. Salt sent for me this morning.
As you see, it’s from the Welsh National Library at
Aberystwyth.”</p>

<p>“That is surely far afield,” remarked Ludlow.</p>

<p>“It may seem so. But I believe that when Mr. Salt hears of
it, he’ll agree with me that it’s an important item in our list.
In fact, my Lord, it’s the keystone of my arch.”</p>

<p>While his eyes travelled along the lines, Oxford’s face was
blank. Obviously he did not perceive the slightest link
between the matter of the telegram and the matter in hand. He
was not even puzzled; he was irretrievably befogged.</p>

<p>“Will someone repeat it aloud, please? It will save so much
time.”</p>

<p>Crofts snatched the sheets from Oxford’s fingers and commenced
to read. The eagerness in his voice subsided while he
went on to an uncomfortable conclusion with an air that he
was being made a fool. Our confusion increased with rapt
attention, but the sisters Delambre seemed utterly uninterested,
and I believe that the Constable had already dropped into a
doze. The message ran about as follows:<a href="#note6" id="noteref6">¹</a></p>

<p>“May I have it back? Thank you. And now straight to the
point. People, I suppose you think that if we could only put
our fingers down tight on one person, our troubles would be
over. I mean Parson Lolly—not the Parson of Mr. Maryvale’s
sad delusion, but the real one.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” remarked Crofts.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said very quietly, “if there is one part of these
mysteries I know I hold the clue of, it’s the Parson. I <em>know</em>
who the Parson is.”</p>

<p>The tableful of us stiffened as if we had been plunged in an
electric bath.</p>

<p>“Then who, who, who?” Crofts burst out.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t excite yourself. There never was any reason
to be excited about Parson Lolly. Parson Lolly is a dud.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is!” hooted Bob incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is, I tell you. I can’t believe for a minute that he
has any unusual power. You can hardly say that he has any
power at all; at least, it’s delusive rather than formidable.
Why, he’s done nothing but deliver threats and make gestures,
and some of us have been imagining we’re the victims of
supernatural pranks.”</p>

<p>“Supernatural or not,” growled Crofts, “I’ll give him a fine
quarter of an hour when I lay hands on him. Who is he?”</p>

<p>The American girl looked him straight in the eye, severely,
and he subsided with vague rumblings. “Now, I stipulate that
you shall do nothing of the sort. If you intend to make this
the excuse for working off your surplus bad temper, I won’t
go any further.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go bail for him,” promised Alberta.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t pay any attention to me,” said Crofts.</p>

<p>The American girl leaned her chin in her hand and studied
the table with thoughtful eyes. She spoke slowly, tentatively.
“Suppose I set the evidence before you and see if your
conclusion isn’t the same as mine. Beginning, perhaps, with that
night Millicent wandered out on the lawn, and I with her.
It was the clock in the corner there that started all the trouble;
neither the Parson nor any human being here could have foreseen
the effect that melody would have on Millicent when she
heard it through her dreams. But somewhere on the lawn we
two collided, you might say, with a separate series of events.
First of all it was the devilish, goggling face that glared down
at us from an instant from the air. And let me remind you that
it was not only an enormous face—I was frightened, but I’m
not exaggerating—it was also high up in the air. We know the
Parson is tall when he stands full length, but even he can’t
extend indefinitely. Well, we saw this perfectly hellish face,
just for an instant, and it hasn’t been seen again—that way.
Mr. Salt took most of it away with him when he left the Vale
this evening.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” jogged in Crofts.</p>

<p>“Let me go on, please. The head was one thing. Then there
was the placard: ‘Parson Lolly sends regards. Look out for
Parson Lolly.’ That was the first of a number of such messages
that have been found all about the place, and why <em>this</em>
one, at any rate, should have caused us such great alarm, I
can only account for by supposing that we’d caught the spirit
of panic from the servants. On sober reflection, I should think
that that placard demonstrated a sort of ingenuousness in Parson
Lolly.”</p>

<p>“A damned funny sort of ingenuousness,” remarked our host.
“What about the axe and the blood we found?”</p>

<p>“I was just going to remind you of them. The blood, as
you know, we learned to be that of one of a batch of little pigs,
and its carcass was found this afternoon along with the head.
As for the axe, you remember that Doctor Aire pointed out
how light and impracticable it was, and how it had been
removed from low down on the armoury wall. The final thing
was that Mr. Bannerlee’s hat had been deposited on the lawn.
The rest was merely excitement. I am able, though, to add a
point or two borrowed from Mr. Bannerlee.”</p>

<p>I received a burning glance from Crofts. “From you? Have
you been holding something back all this time?”</p>

<p>The American girl swiftly continued. “These are notes from
the diary Mr. Bannerlee commenced that night.”</p>

<p>They all exclaimed, “Diary!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; don’t be so surprised at everything, or we shan’t
get through. Don’t let them bother you, Mr. Bannerlee. A
little later I’ll say something more general about the diary, but
now I confine myself to a pair of small points. One is that
while he came down the path from the uplands to the Vale,
he heard a voice somewhere in the fog below, shouting—an
indeterminate sort of voice with a quality he couldn’t quite
describe. Now, I believe that was Parson Lolly’s voice, the
same queer voice we heard the night before Mr. Bannerlee
came. And the second point is this. Late in the afternoon before
Sean met his death, Mr. Bannerlee was standing on the roof
outside his window. Crofts had told him how the sun strikes
the tumulus in Great Rhos at sunset. Mr. Bannerlee looked
down, as it chanced, and saw a tiny piece of rope beneath the
parapet that runs along there. It was lying at the edge of one
of the merlons, which have been scraped fairly smooth and have
their corners sharp. It is my belief that this scrap was part of
the clothes-line rope and that it had something to do with
Parson Lolly’s visit the night the conservatory window was
smashed, also on the night previous to Mr. Bannerlee’s
advent.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” Crofts broke in. He had gradually been sliding
to the edge of his chair again. “Why can’t you give up
beating about the bush and tell us out and out?”</p>

<p>“I’d have to go over it all anyhow,” returned Miss Lebetwood.
“I’m wondering if these straws seem to you to point the
way I think they do. You must let me tell this in my own
way. There isn’t much more, and for that I have to thank
Mr. Bannerlee also.”</p>

<p>“You mean my visit to the tower?” I asked. “The Superintendent
could help you there. He must have scoured the place
long before me.”</p>

<p>“He did, as it happens. But he left matters there as he found
them, and it was through reading your diary that I heard of
the variegated lot of objects which probably belonged to the
Parson. For instance, you found shavings from the pencil
which had written the placards. You also saw some splashes,
unquestionably the blood of the little pig. Then there were
fragments of wood and scraps of crêpe, left over from the
construction of the head. Another thing was a pungent smell
that you couldn’t identify. I think that was all except a
torn-off corner of the title-page of a book; something ending in
‘CATTI.’ I would have telegraphed for information about
that, too, this morning, but when I asked the Superintendent,
he was able to tell me right away what the book is. It’s been
quite a common one in Wales for generations: ‘The Adventures
and Vagaries of Twm Shon Catti,’ who is described as
a wild wag of Wales. He was a real person two hundred years
ago, Mr. Salt told me, and a great many legends have sprung
up about him, so that his exploits as a highwayman and a hero
and a man of chivalry make up quite a readable book. It was
borrowed from your library, Crofts, but I noticed this
morning that it was back in its place.”</p>

<p>Our host now seemed sunk in meditative gloom. “What
of it?”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose I recapitulate. As I see it, the night before
Mr. Bannerlee came, the Parson intended to invade the House,
but his plans were awry. Although the head was made, he
didn’t bring it with him; this was to be an experimental sortie.
He came by way of the kitchen yard, and took down the
clothes-line that was hanging there and brought it with him.
He made a loop, a lasso, with one end of the rope and flung
it up the side of the House until he succeeded in drawing it
tight about one of the merlons of the battlement. Then he
began shouting through a megaphone, and even if you had
heard his voice previously you wouldn’t have recognized it
then. And he was still shouting while he commenced to walk up
the wall of the House.”</p>

<p>I thought Crofts was going to levitate from his chair. “A
megaphone!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear young lady,” objected Aire, “the man must
have had a hand too many. I grant you, he might have hauled
himself up the outside of the House, but he’d need both hands
for it; where does the megaphone come in?”</p>

<p>“You people will interrupt,” said the American girl. “The
explanation is simple. The megaphone came from old Watts’
storeroom, of course. Don’t you remember that there are
relics in there of early days of sport—even some oars and a
sliding seat from a shell? A rowing coxswain uses a megaphone,
doesn’t he, and there’s an attachment for keeping it
tight against his mouth while both hands are occupied with
the rudder chains. Parson Lolly, I imagine, can manage as
well as most coxswains. Anyhow, he <em>was</em> climbing, and
he <em>was</em> shouting when his foot slipped and there he dangled.
Instead of letting go the rope, he held on, and the result was
that he began to sway back and forth. Of course he tried to
steady himself by reaching one foot out to the wall, but instead
of checking his momentum he kicked away from the wall, and
his pendulum swing carried him neatly through the window
of the conservatory. He wasn’t as much as scratched.”</p>

<p>“Unbelievable,” declared Crofts. “And supposing by a
miracle he wasn’t cut to pieces, what became of him?”</p>

<p>The American girl went on quietly. “When my brother was
a high-school lad, he had a soccer ball at home. One evening
in an unlit hall he stepped on it accidentally and it sent him
clean through a glass door without his losing a drop of blood.
It isn’t an unusual thing, after all. As for how the Parson
got away, he really didn’t—then. You see, the swing of the
rope had gradually ground it to bits where it rubbed against
the sharpened merlon. When the Parson swung through the
window, the rope broke and he came down on his feet inside
the conservatory. Lucky for him, perhaps, that he did, if he
wanted to evade us, for all he had to do was to draw the
rope in after him and wait until we had spent our patience
looking for him in the grounds. None of us had a thought of
searching inside.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m—” Crofts muttered, breaking off into stupefaction.
No one else said a word, only stared at the American
girl, and waited.</p>

<p>“That night we may assume Parson Lolly escaped as soon
as the coast was clear. But he escaped only to plan new
mischief for the next evening. And again his schemes miscarried.
I think it is easier to reconstruct what happened this
time. For one thing, he brought the head with him.” Crofts
seemed about to break in, but desisted. “He was carrying the
blood as well; he must have slaughtered the piglet a little
while before he set out from the tower, for the blood had not
begun to clot. Earlier, he had been prowling inside the House
and had pilfered the little battle-axe and the cap belonging to
Mr. Bannerlee.”</p>

<p>“But, dearest, you aren’t making it a bit clearer,” said
Alberta. “What could it have all been for?”</p>

<p>“It was to give us the scare of our lives.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t it?” muttered Oxford. “Dash him!”</p>

<p>“But not as planned. Sean pointed that out at once, I believe.
The Parson’s intention that night was to stage a fictitious
murder. There were the weapon, the gore, and the hat which
was to be discovered reeking with blood. We were to find these
things, and in the midst of our excitement we were to be
thrown into a panic when the head—went off—probably
somewhere on the battlement, or even above.”</p>

<p>“The head, the infernal head!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Crofts; it appeared when they dug it up this
afternoon—Harmony told me—that it had been constructed somewhat
like a kite and could have been flown quite easily. That
occurred, in fact. When Millicent and I inadvertently crossed
the Parson’s path and he dropped everything and legged it, the
kite did fly up a little way, and then—went off.” She
addressed me. “When it crashed to the ground, Mr. Bannerlee,
the Parson still held the cord, and you distinguished the head
as a black mass sliding across the lawn.”</p>

<p>“I grant you the kite and the rest of the fol-de-rol,” cut in
Lord Ludlow, in a voice like the broken edge of a cake
of ice. “I fancy, however, that this ‘going off,’ as you call it,
needs more explanation than you’ll readily find.”</p>

<p>“The hellish thing couldn’t have been lit with a match like
a Hallowe’en turnip,” added Crofts.</p>

<p>The American girl slowly shook her head and smiled. “On
the contrary, for me that was about the easiest guess of all as
soon as I read how Mr. Bannerlee smelt powder in the tower.
Don’t you see, the Parson must have carried a small dry
battery connected by a length of wire with the magnesium charge
in the head? It was an ordinary flash-light powder such as is
used for taking photographs.”</p>

<p>There was a long interval of sagging silence. I cannot
speak for others, but my own mind struggled with an obstacle
it could not grasp. There must be some egregious contradiction
involved in this idea. Flashlight! Who had owned a
flashlight?</p>

<p>“But, Miss Lebetwood, you yourself—it can’t be—you’re
the photography expert here. You didn’t—yourself—”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment! I’ve got it!” Aire whistled. “Someone told
me other other day—you’d been teaching Toby how to take
flashlight photographs. Didn’t you bring down some old
apparatus of yours and give it to him last week?”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” said the American girl. “It’s been Toby all
along, of course.”</p>

<p>“Toby!” Crofts was only beginning to see the light.</p>

<p>“Toby, who else?”</p>

<p>“God!” Crofts seemed to choke for breath. “Do you mean
to say that lad killed Cosgrove—killed Heatheringham? I can’t
believe it.”</p>

<p>“He never killed anybody. Don’t you see, Parson Lolly has
no connection with these murders?”</p>

<p>“Eh, what?”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be switched!”</p>

<p>“I’ll be damned!”</p>

<p>The American girl gave Ludlow a particular look. “It hardly
needed the new psychology to give us the right lead. I’m
amazed, really I am, that no one has thought of it before.
Why, what activities did the Parson engage in? His plots
were just the sort of thing that an artless—and artful—child
would plan to frighten a grown person.”</p>

<p>“Or a grown person to frighten a child,” appended Aire.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so, but there could be no such intention here,
of course. As soon as I got my wits about me the night Mr.
Bannerlee arrived, I suspected some juvenile escapade. The details
unfolded to fit the theory. There was the little battle-axe
from low on the wall, whereas the big ones hung out of reach.
That later night, who but a small boy could have crawled
underneath the arch of the bridge in the park when the Doctor
and Mr. Bannerlee were so brisk on his trail? Then there
was the book: hardly anyone but a lad nowadays would take
much interest in a work as naïve as ‘Twm Shon Catti.’ A
boy, however, might be much struck with it, and it probably
fired Toby to emulation of Twm—a bloodyish emulation.
There was his cloak, too—that was rather puerile, although it
was a neat dodge all the same.”</p>

<p>“Where does the neat dodge come in?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Why, to add to his stature. A tiny Parson Lolly would be
in danger of being identified with a boy, if there happened to
be a boy in the neighbourhood. That was the reason for the
exceedingly large and flowing garb. He must have had strapped
to his shoulders one of those contrivances that magicians use
to ‘produce’ objects, an apparatus that could be folded or
extended by pressure on some spring. No wonder Millicent and
I saw no head on him! That sort of stunt is as old as conjuring,
I believe, and the appliance probably came from the
exhaustless variety of old Watts’ attics.”</p>

<p>The American girl leaned back in her chair, settling her
head against the leather and closing her eyes, as if grateful for
a chance to rest. The accumulation of details which she had
picked out left no doubt whatever that the houseful of us
had been hoaxed and flummoxed by a child, that Aidenn Vale
was Cock Lane repeated on a twentieth century scale.</p>

<p><em>But it could not be!</em></p>

<p>There were facts, cold, stony facts, that loomed mountain
high, cutting off this path. These facts could not be avoided.</p>

<p>“But, Miss Lebetwood!” I cried hoarsely, “it won’t do.”</p>

<p>“Won’t do!” resounded the voice of our host, a man of
imponderable mind.</p>

<p>“The placards!” I insisted. “Why, I remember clearly the
one in Cosgrove’s room had been left after Toby had gone to
wherever-it-was to fetch my bag—absolutely no question about
that. That afternoon, too, the one Mrs. Bartholomew picked up
by the library tower: I’ll swear by the beard of the Prophet
it wasn’t there when I went past a few minutes before the
tragedy occurred. And Toby was peeling potatoes then. It’s
inconceivable—absolutely inconceivable—that he could have
had anything to do with them.”</p>

<p>Her eyes still shut, Miss Lebetwood said quietly, “I think
I can tell who it was. Not Toby, I’ll admit, but that doesn’t
alter the rest of what I’ve said about him. Toby didn’t write
those placards, or leave them, and I am sure he knows no
more about them than he knows about—that one there!”</p>

<p>The hair at the back of my neck prickled, and my spine
seemed to be wriggling in convulsions. A dozen cries, loud or
stunned, sounded as if from one multi-vocal throat. For the
American girl’s eyes were open now, and her arm pointed to
the musicians’ gallery. Indistinct, hanging outside the bright
zone of the globe, but unmistakable, a fifth placard was
suspended from the rail of the balustrade.</p>

<p>“My God!”</p>

<p>“I’ll take oath that wasn’t there when we came in,” declared
Crofts, and many voices supported him.</p>

<p>It was I who rose like a brisk automaton, kicked my chair
back against the wall, and sped up the stairs to the gallery,
where I had never set foot before. The placard hung by a black
thread attached to a pin. I seized it, carried it down to the
light. Now we might have been some multi-headed creature
studying the inscription:</p>

<blockquote class="placard">

  <p>TOnigHT my LAst NiGHt  BeSt REGards  PARSON
  LOLLY</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Only the American girl remained limp in her chair, not
bending forward for a sight of the words. While my gaze, as
it must, fell on her and lingered there, ever such a shadowy
smile crept from her lips to her eyes.</p>

<p>“Good people, good, good people, please don’t misjudge me.
That placard has been hanging there since long before you
came in. You didn’t see it because you weren’t on the look-out
for it.”</p>

<p>“You knew it was there?” Crofts boomed. “And you didn’t
warn us?”</p>

<p>“Warn you? Against myself?”</p>

<p>“Against yourself, dearest?” cried Millicent Mertoun, her
face suddenly worn with anxiety.</p>

<p>Miss Lebetwood said, “I wrote that placard. I wrote it this
evening and put it up there after Marvel’s crystal-gazing
to-night. I did it just to show you that anybody could make a
placard like that. This is the fifth, and perhaps the four others
were done by four different persons.”</p>

<p>Accompanying the last words of her speech, the first strokes
of twelve began to sound from the clock in the corner. There
was a spell in the sound of its old music. We were hushed.</p>

<p>For the only time I saw Lord Ludlow’s face absolutely grey
with fear. “There’s something moving in the wall!”</p>

<p>“Not in the wall—on the wall!”</p>

<p>Indeed, high up, above our solitary light, something rubbed
and scraped near the portrait of Sir Pharamond. From
somewhere else in the room came a soft murmur, as of a
smooth-running reel. Belvoir caught hold of the bulb by its brass top
and raised it overhead. Within the brightness now, the colours
of the portrait were sharper and more brilliant than they had
appeared in the austere dimness of the Hall.</p>

<p>But Sir Pharamond was not still; he writhed and rocked,
and a loud outcry was evidence we saw the blood oozing from
the wound upon his cheek.</p>

<p>A moment later down fell Sir Pharamond with a sound of
splintering wood and ripping canvas. The wall where the
portrait had been was quite smooth and blank.</p>

<p>The quiet chime of the old clock had not ceased to ring.</p>

<h2>XXVII. <br> The Purr of the Cat!</h2>

<p>Blood on the pallid cheek of Sir Pharamond, and
his downfall, as had been prophesied in the olden time! I saw
no one else, heard no one else, only gaped at the ruined
portrait and was conscious of the clock’s melodious voice. An
epoch seemed to pass before my senses ceased to dance, and I
found myself one of the faltering semicircle which closed about
the shattered portrait.</p>

<p>But beyond the area of brightness I made out indistinctly
the most amazing thing of all. The sisters Delambre sat by
the fireplace precisely as they had been since we entered the
Hall. The short, stodgy one seemed quite absorbed in the
flickering embers; the taller of the two had merely turned her
head in our direction. Even the Constable seemed bereft of
reflexes. This lack of surprise, this apathy, this uncanny silence
impressed me just then as a thing more incredible than the
disaster close at hand.</p>

<p>I still stared at the strange pair, while conscious that Aire
had slipped before us, standing over the wreck of the portrait.
He turned and faced us, and the small voice of the man seemed
charged with a booming importance.</p>

<p>I heard him vaguely. “I told Salt,” came in somewhere, and
then, “Crofts put me up to it, really.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy, crazy,” claimed Crofts.</p>

<p>“I tell you it never would have happened if you hadn’t
been so fractious this morning. I said this sort of thing might
conceivably take place. Well, it has, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Eve Bartholomew ventured. “You mean that you—you—”</p>

<p>“Very simply indeed.” Aire hunched his shoulders appreciatively.
“A matter of two spools and a bit of string connected
with the mechanism of the chimes. A scurvy conjurer’s trick;
that’s all. I apologize.”</p>

<p>“But the blood!” I cried in a sudden access of emotion.
“Spools and strings don’t produce blood. I saw it oozing from
the cheek!”</p>

<p>Aire smiled, shook his head slightly. “No, they don’t. But
then, you didn’t see blood oozing from the cheek.”</p>

<p>Half a dozen hot affirmatives contradicted him.</p>

<p>“I tell you no. You’re all acquainted with the prophecy of
the bloody cheek, and you were all hypnotized.”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to tell me,” bullied Crofts, brushing the little man
aside and bending to the wreckage.</p>

<p>Aire smiled dryly. “That’s not blood, you see; it’s painted
blood.”</p>

<p>“Wh‑at!” cried Crofts, holding up a portion of the canvas.
“You daubed this stuff on my painting?”</p>

<p>“Not I; Maryvale. And that’s not your painting, by the
way.”</p>

<p>Crofts could only mutter.</p>

<p>“Don’t be disturbed, my friend. This portrait is a rush order,
as they say in America, a copy done for me this afternoon by
Maryvale. You’ll find the original under his mattress, poor
chap.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all—” Crofts relapsed into dumb glowering.</p>

<p>Aire made a slight movement of disdain. “Why be so upset?
It was only a trick—a cheap trick, I admit—and I take the full
responsibility, ladies and gentlemen. I almost wish it hadn’t
occurred, but dogmatic people sometimes get on my nerves.
And now let’s forget about it and get back to the table; we
were really learning something there. Paula, I hope this hasn’t
too awfully disconcerted you? You can go on with it?”</p>

<p>She forced a smile. “Yes, certainly. Do come on, people; it’s
getting awfully late.”</p>

<p>We returned to our places not much more comforted than
when we had sprung from them a few minutes before. It was
all very well to speak of parlour tricks, but there was no ease in
sitting around the table in that darkened room with those
images of lethargy dwelling by the fire, and no cheer in waiting
through the lonesome night, wondering from what direction
some new terror might leap upon us. But there we were.</p>

<p>“. . . bearings of Sean’s death,” Paula Lebetwood was
saying. She went on in a strange voice: “He was struck and
fell dying where I found him by the tower. Then the weapon,
as we now know, was hurled down there, too. But we have to
admit that as far as we can tell none of us could have been at
the tower at that time. Nobody except Wheeler met Sean—or
will admit he did—after our quarrel in the Hall. So, stated
in those terms, there is an irreconcilable contradiction in Sean’s
death. Only there is no contradiction save in words; for we
know, well enough, that somebody <em>must</em> have struck him, and
therefore somebody must have been there.</p>

<p>“In Mr. Heatheringham’s death there were differences,
though in some respects it was much the same. In the first
place, he must have seen something hostile or there would have
been no revolver shot. The trail of blood across the floor, too,
showed what had been the murderer’s line of retreat. But the
most unusual thing, surely, is one that Doctor Aire can explain
better than I. Will you, Doctor?”</p>

<p>Aire looked at her inquiringly. “I suppose you mean the
rigidity—cadaveric spasm, as we call it? What do you want
me to—?”</p>

<p>“It shows something about the way he was killed, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it does. The topic is of great interest to one of my
profession; we come across it so seldom, save on the battlefield.
We know something about it, though, enough to be sure that
there are certain definite predisposing factors.”</p>

<p>She nodded. “Yes, I meant that. Please go on.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sudden</em> death is one, and death due to violent disturbance
of nervous system. Then the last contraction of the muscles
during life persists with more rigidity even than in the
usual <i>rigor</i>.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you people see what I mean by harping on these
gruesome things,” said the girl. “Thank you, Doctor. This
abnormal state of things taken with the shot through the broken
window proves that Mr. Heatheringham was killed right where
we found him. I mean he couldn’t have been bludgeoned
outside—say where I found Sean lying—and have crawled back
into the Hall and raised himself to the window to fire at
whoever might have been there. So far, we have no idea who
was with him; yet I think it must have been one of the
servants or one of us—more likely one of us.”</p>

<p>No one chose to say anything in the brief silence she left.
Presently, in a fresher tone, she resumed.</p>

<p>“That’s how the problem stood yesterday: just death, simple
and inexplicable—violent death without a real motive—violent
death without an agent, apparently. Even the discovery of the
stone has been no help in finding the agent; anybody could have
grabbed a stone from the rockery.”</p>

<p>Crofts muttered, “Why go over all that again? We’ve known
it from the start.”</p>

<p>“I apologize. I only mentioned those things to go on to say
that it’s useless to think about them any longer. We could
continue for weeks and months mulling over motive and
method—mulling over time and place and all the rest of it that makes
an endless circle. Last night, though, I thought of a new
way.”</p>

<p>“New?” the words sprang from Belvoir’s lips.</p>

<p>She paused and looked about the table. “I—I’m a little
nervous about telling you my idea. The thing was, I suddenly
thought of Mr. Bannerlee’s diary.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fine one!” I put in ironically. “You thought of
it when nobody but Crofts and Heatheringham had ever heard
of it—unless Heatheringham told Salt!”</p>

<p>“As it happens, I’ve known about it all along. A few minutes
before luncheon the day of Sean’s death, you and Crofts
came upstairs to the first-storey landing together. I had changed
after playing tennis and was just going downstairs. Although
the two of you suddenly lowered your voices when you saw me,
I had already heard you, Mr. Bannerlee, say that you had been
up till nearly morning and had done more than five thousand
words. Crofts said he hoped you had got it straight, and that
left no doubt what you had been writing. But I was much too
polite, then, to let you know I guessed what you were doing. . . .
And before I go on, people, let me say that as far as I
can tell, no record has ever been written with fewer
mistakes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I acknowledged.</p>

<p>“Humanly and”—here she slipped in a smile—“archæologically
speaking, that is. You can’t expect one person to write
a story that would satisfy every question that flits through
another person’s mind. I’m not sure that I like his style, either,”
she remarked, rather abstractedly, “though you couldn’t judge
it very well in that fragmentary state—except, I think, he
fancies his power of description and likes to make a passage
effective now and then. But while I read, I began to feel the
diary was just suited to the purpose I had in mind.”</p>

<p>“Which was—?” said Lord Ludlow, who gave the
impression of long-suffering patience.</p>

<p>“I wanted to find the killer without bothering how he killed.
I expected the diary would help me to look on all you people
divested of my own prejudices. Through the diary I could
judge you more fairly, and more strictly than I could in my own
mind. Meeting you there would be like meeting new persons,
all of you except Crofts and Alberta being new to Mr.
Bannerlee. The diary is really full of side-lights on people and
little bits of character. Maybe, though, I was expecting too
much from Mr. Bannerlee. How could he come to know us in
a day, or a week? He couldn’t. He saw us only from the outside
and the diary reveals only the outside of us. Without being
disrespectful either to you or to Mr. Bannerlee, I must say I
was reminded of clowns in a circus. Most of us seemed to be
doing the same thing over and over again. Ted Belvoir and
Lord Ludlow were eternally carrying on a silly debate; Eve
was making a fresh prophecy every day, and not one of them
came true; Crofts seemed to be growing grouchier every time
he was mentioned; Gilbert Maryvale spent most of his afternoons
leaving cryptic remarks about, so to speak; Lib’s mission
in life was talking gibberish to Mr. Bannerlee. Everyone
seemed to be posing as an idiot, quite an innocent idiot. Well, it
turned out that my most important discovery in the diary
wasn’t a character after all, but a fact.”</p>

<p>“A fact you didn’t know before?” asked Belvoir.</p>

<p>The American girl smiled faintly. “First of all, though, if
Mr. Bannerlee doesn’t mind, I want to tell you the big secret
he’s been keeping from us. Do you mind, Mr. Bannerlee?”</p>

<p>I bowed the responsibility on to her shoulders with a smile.
“I think you should tell us beforehand how you found
out—what you did. I’d like to know myself.”</p>

<p>“I was going to. People, you remember the other day, Mr.
Bannerlee went on the hilltops again, and he was so taken with
the view of distant mountains that he drew sighting lines on his
map to show which ones were visible. The sighting lines, of
course, were drawn from the same spot, and that spot was on
Whimble. After orienting his map, he squinted across it,
looking toward the Malvern Hills and the Black Mountain and
elsewhere to establish lines of vision. He could even see to
Plinlimon; that’s about thirty miles away. You did see
Plinlimon that day, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Well, that was how I knew you hadn’t been on Whimble,
whose highest point has an elevation of about 1950 feet. The
highest point on Plinlimon is less than 2500. Thirty miles
apart and only five hundred feet difference. Now, if Mr.
Bannerlee stood anywhere on Whimble and he looked toward
Plinlimon, Great Rhos, just across the Vale, would be between
him and the mountain. Great Rhos is a flattish sort of
hill, and its elevation is 2166. Think that over.”</p>

<p>“How idiotically, infernally stupid of me!” I cried.</p>

<p>“But I don’t see—” said Eve Bartholomew blankly.</p>

<p>Others about the table uttered exclamations that showed
their understanding or betrayed their confusion.</p>

<p>The American girl turned to Mrs. Bartholomew. “You see,
dear, if you were nineteen feet high and wanted to see
something ten yards away that was five feet higher than you, you
couldn’t do it if there was a wall a foot higher than you less
than a yard away.”</p>

<p>To give her credit, Mrs. Bartholomew grasped the point
instantly. But she still was dubious. “Then how did Mr.
Bannerlee see the mountain?”</p>

<p>“He must have been somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“But you said he <em>said</em> he was on Whimble.”</p>

<p>I laughed. “No, I didn’t say so, Mrs. Bartholomew. I was
satisfied to let people think so, though.”</p>

<p>“Why was that?” interjected Lord Ludlow sharply.</p>

<p>The American girl turned to him. “He wanted to reserve a
little share of glory for himself. Why should he have told us
his special secret, or even write it down in the House, before
he knew what kind of people we were? I think Mr.
Bannerlee was very sensible.”</p>

<p>I smiled, recalling a somewhat different reaction to my
“antiquarianism” that afternoon.</p>

<p>“But what does it all mean?” Mrs. Bartholomew came in
plaintively.</p>

<p>“That’s what I wondered this morning,” answered the American
girl. “Mr. Bannerlee, I suppose by this time you know the
reason why I took that campstool; in fact, you had written the
reason yourself somewhere. ‘What a difference a few feet make
in the prospect!’ You are a bit taller than I am, and there was
just that barest risk that you could see further from Whimble
than I could. But when I reached the tippy-top of the hill and
set my campstool there and stood on it, I knew I had as good
a chance as you of peeping over Great Rhos. But I couldn’t.
So I knew you must have been somewhere else when you saw
Plinlimon, and I could only suppose that the reason you’d
hidden your whereabouts was your discovery of the oratory,
after three hundred years.”</p>

<p>“The oratory!” Doctor Aire reached out a hand to me. “My
congratulations, Bannerlee!”</p>

<p>“And mine!” said Belvoir.</p>

<p>“After three hundred years!”</p>

<p>“The oratory!” cried Lib. “Bannerlee, you’ve been false
to me. Couldn’t you trust lil’ Lib?”</p>

<p>“So that was it,” muttered Crofts. “You needn’t have been
so close about it.”</p>

<p>“Really a downy bird,” giggled Alberta.</p>

<p>I faced the American girl. “This is almost—gratuitous, you
know. These unfortunate people are waiting for you to cast
some light upon their darkness, not to herald any trifling
discovery of mine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I <em>had</em> better be getting on toward solving the mystery,
if we’re ever to be done to-night. The queer thing is that
guessing about Mr. Bannerlee’s discovery is what put me on
some sort of a track. In fact, if Mr. Bannerlee’s matches hadn’t
given out that afternoon he saw the rainbow, I never, never
would have seen the path—that sounds like a figure of speech
almost, and a paradox, but I mean just that.”</p>

<p>“Matches!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Bannerlee, by the time you had reached the
House you might have been excused for thinking Fate was
playing with you. And, by the way, people, a little while ago
Mr. Bannerlee explained to me how he had brought his quarto
of Sylvan Armitage to Radnorshire with him after all. Naturally,
when he left it in the oratory by chance, he did not care
to tell us about it, on account of his precious secret. So he
had just recovered his copy and was bringing it down the
Vale with him that afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to get out of the sixteenth century?”
inquired Ludlow. “It seems to me that you are leading this
discussion along the lines of a wranglers’ tea-party.”</p>

<p>“Do forgive me for wasting so much time. The Book of
Sylvan Armitage interests me so much; indeed, it helped me
tremendously. Mr. Bannerlee caught me reading it the other
night; did he tell you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing criminal in that,” said Belvoir.</p>

<p>“N‑no, but it was slightly—unconventional. The passage
where Armitage happened upon the oratory was an admirable
parallel to Mr. Bannerlee’s account in his diary, as I learned
later. Yes, I came to be very glad indeed that I had stolen
down at midnight to get the Book. . . . Now, people, I can’t
go any further without telling you another secret about Mr.
Bannerlee. He won’t forgive me for this, I’m afraid. But he’s
not only a gentleman and a scholar”—I suppressed my indignation
at this outrageous statement—“not only a discoverer
of things so old that they are new—he is also an altruist!”</p>

<p>I bowed my head giddily under this monstrous charge, and
heard her go on to say: “He is defending one of us, one, I think,
whom he had never seen before!”</p>

<p>If dismay were a sign of guilt, there was not an innocent
one among them. Their alarm testified, I think, to the fact
that they had hoped, and hope begot belief, that the crime
would be traced at last to someone outside the Vale. They
had all been innocent to each other before; now to suppose
the murderer sat among them was a shock as great as murder
itself.</p>

<p>“Someone in this room?” whispered Crofts in a voice far
different from his bullying voice.</p>

<p>“Someone at this table?” asked Eve Bartholomew.</p>

<p>“Someone at this table.”</p>

<p>Belvoir made a show of pulling himself together. “See here,
Bannerlee, is this true?”</p>

<p>“That’s not a fair question, is it?” said the American girl.
“Mr. Bannerlee cannot know how much I know about—”</p>

<p>I said, “Frankly, Miss Lebetwood, you are not being as direct
as you promised to be. I am at a loss as to the ‘altruism’ you
refer to. Tell us plainly what you mean, and perhaps I can
be of some assistance. You are mistaken if you believe that I
would shield anyone for a moment who had deliberate murder
at his door.”</p>

<p>“That’s fair. Well, my trump-card is that I know who
burned the evidence that incriminated one of us; no matter
how I know. You burnt it, Mr. Bannerlee, you yourself.”</p>

<p>Their haggard white faces were turned on me. I felt my
cheeks flush. “I think you are alarming our fellow-guests
without good reason. Why, granting, as you believe, I <em>did</em> drop
the paper in the fire, and supposing there were the least
connection between the writer and the crime—which seems
improbable—the mere fact that the Book at this moment belongs to
Crofts’ library doesn’t indicate that one of you discovered the
parchment during some visit here and filled an idle hour doing
its contents into an obsolete style of English. None of you, as far
as I know, are Celtic experts.”</p>

<p>“Emphatically!” declared Lord Ludlow, fixing a reproachful
gaze on the American girl. “Miss, you are confusing a wild
shot in the dark with the reasoning process. This piece of
translator’s work, probably done by someone outside this Valley
and quite unknown to us, can have no connection with any
atrocity committed here. You are far afield, and I do not think
you will help us much unless, as I said, you lift us from the
plane of a wranglers’ tea-party.”</p>

<p>“You may be right,” she confessed. “I shan’t try to convince
you. But it was a tempting lead. And surely it’s not true to
say there’s no connection between the parchment story and
events which have occurred this week.” Elbows on table, she
rested her head on her hands, speaking very thoughtfully. “For
instance, in the old story Hughes related after lunch that day
he called this place the castle on the mill-site. An old, old map
in the library gives Aidenn Vale as ‘Cwm Melin,’ which means
‘Mill Valley,’ I’ve learned, and that is what the Vale was
called in the manuscript; do you remember? The parchment
explains, too, what was meant by the ‘spanning and roofing
of the waters,’ one of Mr. Maryvale’s mystifying utterances.
It referred simply to the fact that when Sir Pharamond built
his second castle here, he roofed in the Water; I suppose the
present stream beyond the towers is a deflected one and the
channel where Sir Brooke was found is the original course.
That may seem far-fetched, but the proof is that Doctor Aire
took from Sir Brooke’s forehead a splinter of the petrified
wood of the mill-wheel itself. When Sir Brooke was carried
down the subterranean stream, his body must have collided with
the edge of the mill-wheel, and passed on. Mr. Bannerlee, in his
expedition to the cellar, must have actually seen the casing of
the wheel, all overgrown with hideous fungi. So there <em>are</em>
connections, of a sort.”</p>

<p>“Quite interesting in the abstract,” said Ludlow tartly. “We
are looking for something, however, which has a tangible link
with a crime of violence. May I suggest that if you have
nothing more to offer us, this meeting adjourns?”</p>

<p>She had not lifted her head; her fists ground into her forehead.
“I shall try to satisfy you, sir, again with Mr. Bannerlee’s
assistance. I think you will recall that there was a sentence
in the parchment to the effect that Sir Pharamond disposed of
his enemies ‘with no more trouble than snuffing a night-light.’
Now, within five minutes after reaching the House, Mr.
Bannerlee discovered a curious thing. Looking through the
armoury window, he saw <em>you</em>, Ludlow. <em>And what were you
doing there? You were snuffing a candle that stood in the old
bracket on the wall!</em>”</p>

<p>Ludlow’s chair was flung back. He was on his feet,
putty-faced, staring at her in utter consternation.</p>

<p>“Are you accusing me?”</p>

<p>Before she could answer, our attention swung to the other
end of the Hall. From somewhere in that semi-darkness came
a muffled rasping sound, as of some huge beast that purred.</p>

<p>Crofts was on his feet now, with eyes that strained to
overcome the gloom. He called, “What’s that?”</p>

<p>Aire strode half-way to the fireplace, turning his head this
way and that. “There <em>is</em> something moving in the wall this time.
Only where?”</p>

<p>“No!” I shouted, above the increasing hubbub. “IT’S THE
PURR OF THE CAT! The purr of the cat means death!
Clear the Hall!”</p>

<p>But I was too late. A glaring light leaped from nowhere,
light so intense it pierced the brain. The walls and roof blazed
with white fire. The persons in the Hall were like figures of
clay, presented and fixed for all eternity in one or another cast
of horror. Some had cowered back beneath the gallery, some
had their hands before their faces, some were forever fleeing,
foot lifted, toward the door.</p>

<p>The Constable and one of the sisters had retreated from
the chimney-piece, while the other woman stooped low before
the fireplace. A thing with the size and form of a man had been
lying there at their feet, unseen. In this white instant I saw
the woman grasp this figure, raising it above her head.</p>

<p>The collapse of the mantelshelf—a black projectile flying
toward me and veering away—a stunning crash—a long greedy
laughter rising from below, clutching us, tearing us, subsiding
in a sudden burst of silence.</p>

<p>Darkness succeeded light. The strong arm of the Delambre
woman still held the man upright: a headless body.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch28">

<h2>XXVIII. <br> The Crash</h2>

<p>Again I smelt powder.</p>

<p>In tingling silence some of us crossed the Hall and regarded
the headless thing. Belvoir lit the other chandelier, and in its
sparkle, to my immeasurable relief, the figure proved to be
the scarecrow which had served in the sisters’ field. The
woman who had stooped in the fireplace and held the effigy in
the path of the leaping, swinging bar sat in her chair, again
impassive. I noted her admirable hands, strong and hairy like
a man’s, her face, broad and full of flesh, but firm and capable.
The bumpkinish policeman touched me on the sleeve and
pointed to the table, a sign we should keep to our own end of
the Hall.</p>

<p>I noted a disturbance there. Crofts, towering over the American
girl, shook her with rude fingers clamped into her
shoulders.</p>

<p>“You—you—”</p>

<p>While I returned to our group, I was struck with the curious
feeling that someone was missing there. Someone had slipped
out. Vaguely I wondered who it had been, and whether his
absence would be revealed when we took our places once
more. But we were not to sit down together again that night.</p>

<p>The American girl had drawn away from Crofts and stood
looking at him, not angrily, but with a certain speculation in
her gaze. My blood rushed up when I saw her white skin
bruised by the marks his fingers had made. She said, “You
think I—?”</p>

<p>“Murderess!” That was like Crofts.</p>

<p>Several of us protested at his folly; the rest were horrified
into dumbness.</p>

<p>Her steady gaze did not fail. “You do suspect me. So did
Mr. Heatheringham—and Mr. Blenkinson has done me the
honour also. But I didn’t do it, people, and—sometimes—I
wonder if anybody did . . . at least in the sense we’ve been
thinking.”</p>

<p>“Nobody did! with that damned engine—that thunderbolt!
Nobody did!”</p>

<p>“Don’t shout so. That engine, as you call it, was Mr.
Salt’s discovery this afternoon while the House was cleared. I
had nothing to do with it just now.”</p>

<p>Crofts’ jaw fell. “Cleared? The House cleared? There
wasn’t anything in this ‘lost’ business?”</p>

<p>“Very little. I did want to find Mr. Bannerlee’s oratory,
but principally I hoped to draw you kind people out of the
Vale. Mr. Salt and I have been associated in a lawful
conspiracy. He and the Scotland Yard Inspector—”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“The Scotland Yard man. He was to arrive at New Aidenn
by motor early in the afternoon since the trains were slow.
While the House was empty, they investigated, and found
this machine. Mr. Salt expected something like it. This was
the real weapon, of course; that stone half buried in the loam
was a blind.”</p>

<p>“You’ve known this—long?”</p>

<p>“How could I? I had a hint of it when I kept finding in
so many places how the old castle here was built on a mill-site:
Cwm Melin, you know. It even happened that Mr. Bannerlee
knew that name and that name only for this place. He had
never heard of Aidenn Vale.”</p>

<p>“The devil with Bannerlee. What’s a mill got to do with it?”</p>

<p>“The mill-wheel, don’t you see, winds up the spring of the
machine. It must be quite automatic, and I dare say at this
moment the cat’s claw—I suppose that’s what it is—the long
heavy arm of iron, is ready to leap out again.”</p>

<p>Doctor Aire’s face revealed a ferment within. “By jingo—I
think I have it. That mocking roar—hideous—was the sound
of water tumbling into a cistern, or a heavy cask. Then if the
cistern discharged over the wheel, the gear actuating the arm
would wind until—yes, by thunder, that’s it!”</p>

<p>“What’s what?”</p>

<p>“We heard the purr. That was the gear winding against the
resistance of the spring—a sword-spring, perhaps. When the
tension exceeded the strength of the spring, the accursed thing
let fly. There must be a shaft. . . .” The Doctor lapsed into
mumbling.</p>

<p>“Beneath the perfidious tree!” screamed Mrs. Bartholomew
so suddenly that we all jumped. “What does that mean?”</p>

<p>Miss Lebetwood answered, “There was once a cross—see
the traces—carved on the chimney.”</p>

<p>Aire had his eye shrewdly on her. “We can credit you with
the flashlight, can’t we?”</p>

<p>She nodded. “Yes; the camera’s in the gallery, and there
were powders attached to several places on the wall. Constable
Pritchard manipulated the electric button that ignited
them. I hope we have obtained a decent picture of the claw in
mid-air.”</p>

<p>“But who—who’s responsible?” asked Mrs. Bartholomew
plaintively, with outspread hands.</p>

<p>“Dead too long to make any difference,” said Aire.</p>

<p>“Could this, er, machine last for centuries?” Crofts
demanded, shouldering his way to the Doctor.</p>

<p>“For millenniums, without oiling,” returned Aire. “Why not?
The really important thing is—”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” I cried. “About your question, Mrs.
Bartholomew. Remember, Miss Lebetwood, what Maryvale told
me the day he finished his picture? Someone, he said, of the
house of Kay. And, by heaven, he was right!”</p>

<p>“The really necessary thing,” persisted Aire, “is to dismantle
this machine without getting killed. It will be ticklish work,
though, since it’s automatically prepared to lunge out with its
claw on five seconds’ notice. We’ll have to make a start with
the cistern and the wheel.”</p>

<p>“That’s not the first thing, Doctor,” said the American girl.</p>

<p>Aire turned toward her in surprise. “Nothing can be more
urgent. You wouldn’t leave this thing for a night or for an
hour, would you, like a gun primed and cocked? Why, at any
moment, sooner or later, the equilibrium—”</p>

<p>“I think not, and if we hear the purr again we can keep our
distance. Something needs to be done, however, before you
take the machine apart. We must find the real murderer.”</p>

<p>We gave vent to all kinds of sounds, mainly incredulous.</p>

<p>“Listen! We have <em>not</em> discovered yet the person here who
knows Welsh and whom Mr. Bannerlee is shielding.”</p>

<p>I commenced a vain “I haven’t admitted—” but my speech
was charged down.</p>

<p>“I can prove you are!” she cried. “Yes, sir! I want to know
why you are shielding him, or her. All day long I haven’t got
my mind off those matches you wanted so badly after recovering
your own copy of the Book. Do you know, it’s my belief
you knew you were carrying evidence dangerous to someone,
and you wanted to destroy it before you reached the House. I
think it was the translation you actually did destroy later on.”</p>

<p>“Look here—” put in Crofts, reaching out a hand. His face
might have been that of a man sinking under water for the
third time. “Look here—”</p>

<p>“Crofts!” cried Alberta, her eyes bright with agony.</p>

<p>“The parchment and translation were in old Watts’ copy,”
Belvoir snapped.</p>

<p>I doubt if she heard them, intent as she was on the molten
stream of her thought. “This translation, done off-hand,
betrayed someone of us who had a competent knowledge of Welsh
and consequently a head-start, at any rate, in knowledge of the
cat’s claw.”</p>

<p>“It was in old Watts’ copy,” muttered Belvoir.</p>

<p>“When you came into the library, Mr. Bannerlee, you were
about satiated with your attempts to burn the paper. But even
if you couldn’t destroy it, you could get it off your person,
and you did that. You told how you ‘reached your hand up
into a dark corner,’ and you might have added ‘and changed
my quarto with the one on the shelf.’ What happened a few
minutes later when you and Lib were looking over your copy?
A flake of moss fell to the floor; Lib must have noticed it,
for you were scrupulous to mention it in the diary, and you
passed it off with some remark about careless dusting. But I
read in Armitage about moss, and I read about mossy stones
in the diary, and I’ve seen plenty of mossy ones around the
oratory, and you can’t tell me that the copy with the parchment
in it wasn’t the one you’d left up there last week. So I imagine
you knew well enough what Lib had found when she called out
to you while you were leaving the library.”</p>

<p>“How absurd!” I cried.</p>

<p>“ ‘Imagine’ is a well-chosen word,” said Lord Ludlow
crisply. “I am not much edified by this botanical excursion.
You can’t accuse a man of being accessory to murder because
of the way he turns a phrase.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Ludlow,” I nodded. “There’s no need, really—”</p>

<p>“The thing I am driving at,” said the American girl in a
quiet little voice that drilled its way into our brains, “is that
you, Mr. Bannerlee, wrote the translation yourself. There is
no other conclusion, is there?”</p>

<p>“Wilder and wilder!” I exclaimed. “This is too bad, Miss
Lebetwood, when you’ve realized all along that I have no
knowledge of Welsh.”</p>

<p>Our speech had settled into a duel with unmerciful give-and-take.
“Are you sure? Consider this: In the diary your early
references to the Welsh language were all natural and
ambiguous, which puzzled me mightily when I came to other
things later on. Then I saw that you must be taking advantage
of those early references to conceal the fact that you are
really quite adept in Welsh.”</p>

<p>“Took advantage? That’s rather strong, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, just think. You made a pun on the name of St. Tarw,
which means ‘bull.’ You even went out of your way to use
an American expression, that it was a ‘bully name.’ A little
later, when the man you call the gorilla-man shouted at you in
Irish, you knew quite definitely that he did <em>not</em> shout in
Welsh, although Welsh and Irish belong to the same race
of languages, and that particular expression must sound about
the same in one language as in the other.</p>

<p>“But these were trivial compared with the point they hinted
at, and that telegram there clinches the point. You told Lib
all about how you read Ellis Griffiths’ history, and now we
know the manuscript has never been printed, let alone
translated.”</p>

<p>She came close to me, still speaking, and I yielded a step
before the accusations she flung out like weapons. “You
destroyed the manuscript you yourself had made. You hurled the
stone from the rockery into the earth from the balcony outside
your room. And at the same time you dropped the placard
the wind carried down to the corner of the House, and it was
you who left the earlier placard in Sean’s room that morning
when everyone else was downstairs.”</p>

<p>My voice sounded horribly ineffective in its attempt at
surprise. “You accuse <em>me</em>! You accuse <em>me</em>—of—?”</p>

<p>“I do, I do! Haven’t I been putting you on your guard all
morning and all afternoon—ever since I showed you the
campstool? Haven’t I been telling you what I know and hinting
what I’ve guessed? Haven’t I done enough—?”</p>

<p>My laugh, to show contempt, was also a failure. “Preposterous.
It’s a—vertebrate without a skeleton: your theory.
I didn’t want to kill your lover. What motive could I have
had?”</p>

<p>Those blue eyes could be as sharp as steel. She seemed to
be the embodiment of intellect become passionate. “Motive?
Something overwhelmed you stronger than any motive: impulse.
If you had thought two minutes, Sean would be alive to-day.
You had motive, yes, though I’m ashamed to describe it,
but the impulse dwarfed the cause behind it, for once. You
had been thinking about it, hadn’t you, ever since the night
before, and all day long, or there would have been no
threatening message in Sean’s room—but it was that chance, that
chance in a thousand that settled it. I understand now what has
always seemed to me the greatest mystery of all: the motive
you had for the diary and the tremendous trouble you took in
writing five thousand words overnight.”</p>

<p>“I set down the reason plainly: I wanted to clear up the
muddle we all were in.”</p>

<p>“That may have been so when you took up your pen, but
before you laid it down the diary had become a greater thing
than any mere alignment of facts; it had become your defence!
You were someone else, Mr. Bannerlee; the bright and cheery,
affable, not-too-scholarly, antiquarian and athlete—all that
part of you subservient now to something else: Iago!”</p>

<p>“Who was Iago?” asked Mrs. Bartholomew with troubled
mouth. “Something in Shakes—”</p>

<p>“The spider spins its web with all its cunning bound up in
instinct. While you spun your web, Mr. Bannerlee, all your
cunning was bound up in intellect, and you loved each shrewd
knot and strand. Yes, that was it; you came to be in love
with artifice, you laughed in your sleeve at Salt and Doctor
Aire and Heatheringham and me—all people who were trying
to break through your web.”</p>

<p>I had hold of myself now, in spite of the tumult of my heart,
and could return blow for blow. “What nonsense! What a
fool I’d be if I killed a man to preen myself for intellectual
superiority. I tell you again, I never wanted to kill your
lover. What reason had I?”</p>

<p>Her eyes fell for a moment before mine, and a little storm
of wrinkles crossed her brow. “Impulse, impulse, I said, didn’t
I? I think you wrote of it, three times at least. That first
night by the tower—when I and the Parson’s sign were together
inside the circle your torch had cast? Again, after Sean and I
had quarrelled, and yet again as you walked up the Vale in
the twilight and could not forget the quarrel. Afterward too,
when you were so depressed on learning that I was to be
immensely rich. You covered it well, oh, yes! But could I fail
to know what was tugging at you all the while?” She raised
her eyes to mine for a long, grave look. “I suppose you would
call it being in love with me, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>I fought down the thing in my throat. “And suppose I
was—suppose I am—what difference does it make? Must I plead
guilty to a crime I never dreamed of because I had the bad
luck to take a fancy to the face of a woman who’s denied to
me? I was well enough when I walked on the mountain and
felt as if I could move the earth. I wish to God I had stayed
up there, and not come down into this place where Fate takes
the strings and plays her hellish tricks!”</p>

<p>She gave me the most mournful look I have ever seen on any
face. “That’s why I can’t despise you, you know, though I’ve
tried. I can’t look on you as a—a thing of horror. You’ve
played the game right through: you put down every prevarication
and evasion you had made, and then you let me read the
diary. You just—gave yourself away, and did it without a
murmur. When you were up there alone on the Forest and
exulted in your loneliness, you were a man any woman would
have given a lot to march beside. And then you came down
here among us—and how quickly you proved that all our
gods have feet of clay.”</p>

<p>My indignation howled at highest pitch. “I tell you for
the last time that I deny absolutely the trumped-up charge
you keep senselessly repeating.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Denial’s no good. Do you think, as
everyone seems to believe, that terrible machine worked by
chance just now, by some overplus of pressure or loss of
equilibrium? No, Mr. Bannerlee; a man set the cat purring
and the claw lunging. Do you know where he is?”</p>

<p>Silence. . . .</p>

<p>“A man did it?” I repeated, my voice parched and scraping,
my body numb as a block of wood. “A man—did it?” I
remembered I had felt that one of us had secretly left the
Hall. But no—that had been after the deviltry of the machine.</p>

<p>“A man in this House—in your room, Mr. Bannerlee.
Twelve-fifteen was the time set.”</p>

<p>I saw faces leaping and jigging around me, one of them
with great blue eyes and crown of golden hair swinging
enormous toward me and swinging giddily away again. The door
into the corridor, which I had not seen opened, was suddenly
closed from outside. I heard a sea of voices, and above them
shot out the voice of Crofts, booming like a huge wave:</p>

<p>“But my God, how was it done?”</p>

<p>“They found out this afternoon,” said the American girl,
“and Mr. Salt scratched off a few details for me. The mantelpiece
is as old as the castle, and looks and feels sound enough,
but it swings down by means of an invisible hinge. The claw
operates it. The claw must be articulated in some way with a
shaft driven from a water-wheel in the wall below. The
purring sound from the clash of the teeth would draw anyone
toward the fireplace, just in the path of the flying bar as he
stooped to find where the noise came from. The blow was so
terrific it drove Sean through the opening of the french
windows, to crawl a yard or two—and die. Heatheringham was
already dead when he was hurled against the glass, and his
arm striking upward and through the pane that way caused
the revolver he was carrying cocked to explode. I think—that’s
all.”</p>

<p>She had recited all this with the most studied coolness and
precision, this account of the machine—a device surely the
creation of a haunted and tortuous brain. The account completed,
the driving-force which had sustained her was gone, and
she looked weary almost to haggardness. Pity and shame and
grief wrenched me for the part I had played in the fatal story.
When Mrs. Belvoir ended her close-lipped listening of an hour
with a querulous question, I heard someone, Alfred
Bannerlee, speaking as if from far away.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you about that. It was the cats’ heads stuck
everywhere about here that made me wonder if I hadn’t dropped
into Cwm Melin, as it was called in the parchment account.
‘Hear the cat purring under the perfidious tree’ was fresh in
my mind. There was a cat’s head on the firearch, and there
had been a cross above. I can’t say that, er, gave the show
away, but it stirred me up a bit. Upstairs, though, when I saw
the bracket on the wall and thought of ‘no more trouble than
snuffing a night-light,’ an idea seemed spread out as plain as
an open book. I never thought of the mechanism as a certainty,
only as a possibility—barely that. I swear that when I tugged
with my razor strop and brought the wretched bracket down,
I had no idea what might happen. From what I hear, there
must be some sort of weighted valve controlling the flow from
the cistern to the water-wheel. A chain from the bracket
operates the valve and sets the whole damned business in motion.
But I didn’t understand that then. It was all like a
dream—what happened—”</p>

<p>The faces passed into a blur again, jerking up and down.
Voices roared and voices were thin echoes shivering into
silence. Everything was moving, even the sisters Delambre.
One strode across the room like a tempest, tossing her garments
this way and that. The other came waddling after, and was
engaged in a mighty struggle with her hood. The hood came
away, revealing a goodly beard.</p>

<p>A comic-opera transformation had taken place. Suddenly it
was Salt who was standing before me, Salt and a giant of a
man with beefy face. Salt’s expression was ridiculous, for he
was doing his best to make it stern and menacing. The words
in the air seemed to come from his lips:</p>

<p>“Quietly, Mr. Bannerlee.”</p>

<p>Then I thought that I had fainted. But I had not;
instantaneous, utter darkness had swept into the Hall.</p>

<h2>XXIX. <br> Rescue</h2>

<p>Like an imbecile, I waited stock-still in the darkness
for the light to return. The sudden eclipse, however, had
checked my foes as well. I heard their footsteps cease like those
of men who had walked over a cliff.</p>

<p>Not a gleam penetrated the murk. There were cries for
light, and someone tried to scratch a match, ineffectually. I
began to move.</p>

<p>I partly lost my balance, lurched against a man, and heard
his Lordship’s bitter plaint from the level of my knees.
I blundered into the passage without disabling anyone else.
Intuition kept me from blundering toward the front
entrance; later I realized that would have been too obvious
a way. I groped to the left, feeling along the right-hand
wall.</p>

<p>I seemed to wake up in the dinner-room.</p>

<p>Someone else was in there. I heard an anxious whisper:
“Bannerlee . . . Bannerlee . . . that you?”</p>

<p>I recognized a friend. “Yes.”</p>

<p>From the invisible a small, damp, clutching paw clasped
my hand. “You gotta get out of this. Out the window. Snap
into it.”</p>

<p>We were together on the east lawn, running. Thank God
the moon had gone down. Thank God the servants were
asleep.</p>

<p>“It’s a—wise egg that knows—its own rooster. Bannerlee,
your offsprings—couldn’t spot you—as the bloke that finished
Cosgrove. Step on it! I can—keep up.”</p>

<p>“What happened to the lights?”</p>

<p>“I happened to ’em—that’s all.”</p>

<p>We approached a black smudge across the greater dark: a
band of trees. We entered into their depths. I stopped, held
her back.</p>

<p>She whispered frantically, “Step on it! You can’t stay here!”</p>

<p>“No, but I have to decide what comes next. Steady on!
Don’t worry about me; I’ll come clear. What did you do?
Are the lights finished for good?”</p>

<p>“Did you notice I’d sneaked out? I was afraid the lid ’ud
blow off, soon and I wanted to do my bit. I had the dickens
of a time finding the fuse-box in the kitchen. I pulled off the
handle of the big switch com<em>pletely</em>, and gave the rest of the
works a kick so a lot of stuff fell down to the floor. I also cut
the telephone connection into bits to round off a good night’s
effort.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful. I’m surprised you weren’t killed by the
current.”</p>

<p>“Never mind wonderful. I know my electricity. All in the
good cause. Only step on the gas!”</p>

<p>“By Jove, I will!” I cried, divining the sense of this saying.
“I must get a tin of petrol—no, two tins. First, though,
listen. Will you do something more for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes—anything. But make it snappy.”</p>

<p>“I want my diary. Get hold of it and wait for word from
me. Where can I write you safely?”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy. They’ll trace you sure as—”</p>

<p>“Not if you do this right. The book is in the desk drawer in
my room. It’s not locked. It’s your part to conceal the thing,
here, until the wind blows over a bit. The police will believe
I have it, and I want it—for a good reason. Eventually you
can recover it and mail it to the name and address I write
you. Where can a letter reach you safely?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. American Express, London.”</p>

<p>“No good. Are you going to be in the Continent this
winter?”</p>

<p>“I think so. Mummy’s hipped on Nice.”</p>

<p>“American Express, Nice, then. You can send for my letter
if you don’t go there after all. By the way, it will be
addressed to Miss, er, Sarah Vale. Can you remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; I’ll write it down when I get in.” She hung on
my arm imploringly. “Step on it now! You’ll get caught if
you keep hanging around with these by-the-ways and
can-you-remembers. My God, you’ve only a couple o’ minutes’
leeway. I don’t see how you’ll make it.”</p>

<p>I laughed and patted her shoulder. “My dear Lib, I have
a start of at least two hours, probably more. But I shan’t be
foolhardy and lessen the time I have. Goodbye, Lib. I can
never thank you for what you’ve done.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye forever, Bannerlee.” Dim white arms reached
around my neck, and her lips touched mine in a brisk little
kiss. “I’m awful sorry Paula had to spill the beans. She took
the line Cosgrove was her man, and—and all that sort of rot.
Say you aren’t mad at me, or anything. ’Cause I’m to blame
for all this trouble, I guess.”</p>

<p>“No! How could you be?”</p>

<p>“I saw you drop the translation in the fire that night, and
like an ass I let Paula find it out. But I didn’t mean any
harm; honest I didn’t.”</p>

<p>I touched her cheek with my fingers. “You’re absolved, little
Lib. It could have made no difference, eventually. You’re
going to be Mrs. Cullen some day, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, gee, I don’t know. I s’pose I’ll have to be, to get some
peace and quiet.”</p>

<p>“I shall send you a beautiful present from Central Africa or
Siam or elsewhere. May I kiss the bride again?”</p>

<p>I might. And yet again.</p>

<p>I turned away, but swung back. “Tell her—I’ll never forget
her. And I’ll always be sorry for the pain I’ve caused her.
That’s all.”</p>

<p>“I will; sure I will. But, Bannerlee, I want to say something.
I think it’s the limit a real man like you has to light
out because something happened to that doggone Irishman. I
think it’s a goldarn pity Paula couldn’t have fallen for
you—hard. Then she would have kept quiet if they’d torn out her
finger-nails, instead of seeing her duty and doing it to-night,
like a fool. I’m awful sorry. <em>Now step on it!</em>”</p>

<p>She glided and glimmered away. I was a lone outlaw against
the world.</p>

<p>Not a moment squandered now. I dashed for the stables,
with which I was fairly familiar. Cautiously using my torch,
I penetrated the section transformed into the garage. A minute
later, with two petrol tins hugged to my breast, I fled down
the Vale for life. There had not been a single shout from the
environs of the House.</p>

<p>I carried the tins across Aidenn Water and set one down,
returning with the other to the temporary log bridge, which I
must burn behind me. It must have made a comfortable blaze,
soaked as it was with petrol, but I could not stop to witness
this holocaust to Mercury.</p>

<p>Salt’s car was waiting there. I deposited the emergency
tin of petrol in the rear, jumped in, and had no difficulty
in starting the engine. The key had been left on the dashboard,
as I knew it would be. With the fire rising behind me,
merrily I rolled out of the mouth of the Vale to the main
road and toward New Aidenn, embarking on a brief career
of constructive vandalism.</p>

<p>My object was to cut off for as long as might be the
communications of my enemies, the inhabitants of the earth.
The torch revealed that along the edge of the road eight or
ten telephone wires were strung, but shortly before entering
the town I jumped out of the car, clambered up the short
pole, and with the aid of gloves and other things in the
tool-box snipped both right and left.</p>

<p>There were no street lamps in New Aidenn, I had heard,
and I thought it safe to assume that no constable would venture
out of doors there as late as one o’clock in the morning
to recognize my borrowed motor. Not a soul was stirring; the
Police Station was dark. I passed through safely, and halted
the car on the other side of the town to give some attention
to the wires running that way.</p>

<p>My destination was Hereford, but I had until nearly three
o’clock to reach there, and no danger of my losing my road.
So I often halted in my journey when I had passed a village
which might contain a telephone, in order to secure it from
business too early in the morning. Thus I reached Hereford
about ten minutes before the north-to-west express was due.</p>

<p>I left the useful car in an alley near the station, hoping it
would be recognized about dawn and not until then. When
the train was puffing beside the platform, I boldly applied at
the window for a first-class ticket to Exeter (I had been
about to say “Bristol,” when I happened to think “Don’t be
so childishly obvious, like an ordinary criminal. Let Salt think
he’s up against a real antagonist.”) I explained that I had
intended to drop off at Hereford, but would not break my
journey until further on because a person I had met on the train
told me there wasn’t a decent hotel in the place. I needed some
excuse, of course, for the fact that I was not wearing hat and
coat. The booking-clerk seemed rather sleepy, and I remained a
little longer talking to him, to insure that he would
remember me.</p>

<p>Then I boarded the train and entered a first-class compartment
where a gentleman was sleeping. His hat and coat, however,
would not fit me. I merely scraped some of the mud
(quite distinctive mud that said “Aidenn Vale” as plainly
as words) on the floor there. I thought of leaving more “clues,”
but decided not to butter the bread too thick. I passed on to
another compartment in search of vestments. From a gentleman
who was slumbering with his head hanging off the seat I
obtained not only hat and coat, but a mackintosh which from
a distance would look just as well inside-out.</p>

<p>I then found an empty compartment and sat there, wearing
my new-found raiment, until the engine snorted and hunched
its shoulders and commenced crawling southward. When the
train had left the platform, I glanced from the off window to
insure that the station yard was dark, then unlatched the door
and dropped safely to the ground.</p>

<p>All immediately required was to keep out of sight until
the corresponding express from west to north should come in.
It should have arrived a quarter of an hour afterward, but to
my disgust it was late, and I had a worried thirty minutes
among some coals. I devoted the time to cleaning my boots with
my handkerchief, which I stuffed in my pocket, to be burned
later. At length the express pulled in, and when all appeared
ready for departure, I walked quickly up the track beside it.
The south-bound platform was deserted now. This fact enabled
me to choose an empty compartment and enter it by the
off door.</p>

<p>Suddenly remembering my plans for the morrow, however,
I stepped out on the platform and bought some fruit from a
yawning lad who conducted a buffet on wheels. I had thought
at first of stealing the stuff, but buying it would be less
ostentatious. When I had paid for what I had chosen, I took the
first opportunity to steal quite a bit more.</p>

<p>I had really been very lucky. During my absence from the
compartment, tickets had been inspected and doors locked.
Lacking a ticket for this particular train, I might have been
embarrassed. Now I walked hurriedly toward the end of the
train, past the ticket-inspector, around the rear coach, and
along to the off door of my empty compartment again.</p>

<p>I rode north.</p>

<p>At Shrewsbury I alighted for precaution just before the
train drew into the platform, and re-entered my compartment
when the engine had been changed. Near Crewe I definitely
abandoned the train, climbed the bank of a shallow cutting,
and got over the hedge. It was still rather dark, but I had no
difficulty in finding a satisfactory bit of woodland where I
might lie hidden all day.</p>

<p>I was staking everything on one chance, that Paula
Lebetwood had remembered the references to the Bonnet yacht
and that my ticket-taking and perhaps the mud from my
boots would serve to concentrate the attention of the authorities
upon Bristol. If Jack and Mary hadn’t altered their plans,
they would be slipping out of harbour this morning with the
tide, probably five hours before the dogs of righteousness would
arrive hungry at the docks. It seemed reasonable that the
authorities should assume that I was aboard the barque. I knew
for certain that she carried no wireless, and that barring an
unexpected encounter there was no chance of police
disillusionment until she put in in Norway—or Africa.</p>

<p>I intended never to be seen unless for urgent cause, and then,
if possible, by the under-intelligent. Empty compartments on
fast trains by night were to be had for the taking, and even
if the expresses should be crowded, the stopping trains were
available, though on them it would be necessary to turn out at
every station. In the barely credible contingency of my being
nipped and made to pay my fare, I had plenty of money, for
I had cashed a fairly large cheque before setting out for Aidenn
Forest, and I had not stopped to tip the servants before
leaving Highglen House. The train by night and secluded slumber
by day; these were indicated for my recovery.</p>

<p>I shall not detail my week-long, decidedly boring expedition
to Hull. After a couple of days my personal appearance
became run-down, and I dropped into a small market town on
market day, asked a constable directing traffic to assist me to a
hairdresser’s, found the place down a dark dead-end and up a
shaky stair, and enjoyed a haircutting, shampoo, and shave.
I told the attendant that I looked and felt a new man, bought
a packet of safety-razor blades, tipped him enough but not
too much, chatted pleasantly about the price of heifers, and
departed.</p>

<p>About nine that evening, in a restaurant in a larger town,
I expressed a predilection for pickled walnuts.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards I stepped out of a station wash-room,
an unobtrusive dark gentleman to the roots of my hair, with
eyebrows that gave a special appearance to my face.</p>

<p>I carried a passport, thanks to Jack and Mary. From Hull
one Albert Barrerdale sailed eight days after Alfred Bannerlee
had stumbled out of the Hall of the Moth. Praises be for
the men who are supposed to scrutinize the details on
passports, and don’t.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now on my Mediterranean island (whose name, pardon
me, I do not mean to give) I enjoy perpetual sun and the
fruits of never-ceasing summer. I might rest here secure for
the term of my natural life, and I might achieve a sort of
happiness, for here no sensuous pleasure is withheld from man.
Air, sea, and land conspire to lull the soul, and at night from
the village creep up strains of music sweet and spicy. I might
remain—but I think I shall move on.</p>

<p>The Bonnets saved me; no doubt of that. Overweening
sleuth-hounds met a sharp rebuff three months later when
the Bonnet barque, not having touched at any port, returned
to Bristol dock. The emphatic statement of Jack and Mary
that I had not been on board, a statement which they later
attested in order to dispel public mutterings against their
veracity, stunned the police, who had been sitting back and waiting
for me to be delivered up to them from India or Madagascar.
The hounds then were willing, but found no scent. Moreover,
since I had not been aboard the barque, they <em>knew</em> that
I could not have escaped from England, knowledge that must
have proved rather a hindrance than a help.</p>

<p>The diary reached me in a picturesque village in a small
Balkan country. Its disappearance that night, by the way, gave
rise to the amazing belief among several of my fellow-guests
that I had secreted myself within the House, and the consequence
was a general desertion next day. After receiving the
pages, I carried them with me for weeks before lighting on my
isle and commencing my work anew. Now the manuscript is
ready to return, rounded, coherent, and decked with proper
ornament.</p>

<p>My purpose? I have done it for <em>her</em> sake. I don’t care a
penny for the gaping world; all I ask is, let this book stand as
the monument of an ardour which exceeded the orthodox.
Let it be a fantastic tribute to a mistress who never can be
mine. Let it take the place of a sigh and a sob for love’s
labours lost. While I handled and recast this matter, I lived
near her again in Highglen House, shared hours that held
all life’s sweetness, and remembered that she did not despise
me!</p>

<p>If I may offer a suggestion to you who are to receive this
manuscript, I advise that you present it unaltered to the public
as a piece of fiction, with the name of some obscure but
ambitious author upon the title-page. And if he will be so
generous, I trust that Lord Ludlow will write a foreword to
give the thing the stamp of reality.</p>

<p>I trust, finally, that I may be forgiven if I remark that this
is the <em>last</em> that will ever be heard of me.</p>

<p>Paula!</p>

<h2>The Communication of <br> April 17, 1926</h2>

<p>No matter where I am. It is a different place from
where you think, and it will be no good tracing this letter,
for you’ll find only that you are mistaken. The man who is
going to take it to Rangoon and mail it two months hence,
is an outcast like myself and will certainly keep faith.</p>

<p>Occasionally a paper gets through to me from England, and
I read it with more or less amusement. Bloodthirsty wretches,
the English, who would like nothing better than to see me
suspended between time and eternity. But it shall not be.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion as to what “really” happened
the evening Maryvale attempted to shoot the cat. One
copy of a newspaper I came across contained a sort of symposium
on the subject. One or two letters came near the simple
truth, which was that, being afraid of Maryvale’s revolver,
I took the chance which was offered to remove the bullets
from as many cartridges as I could, managing to insure that
his first three shots would be ineffective. Hints that I
deliberately intended to craze the poor fellow, for whom I had a
sincere liking, are false.</p>

<p>Through Lord Ludlow my diary has reached the authorities
upon guarantee that it will not be confiscated, and from official
announcements it seems they believe it to be an equal mixture
of necessary truth and designing falsehood. To my astonishment,
moreover, they have reported that it is a masterpiece
of indiscretion—which is nonsense. About myself, to be sure,
I have perhaps written a thing or two that most men would
not care to have known of them during life. But I am dead.
Yes, in all that concerns life as I knew it, my friends, my
studies, my pleasures—in all that matters—I am dead. The
authorities, however, scoff at the diary, and adduce the “mystic
bone.”</p>

<p>Fools! The episode of the bone hanging white in the gloom
was not invention, or delusion either. It was the white patch
on Cosgrove’s head while he waited in the darkness and
surveyed the Hall, planning Noah’s Flood and the crisis which
would arise when Sir Brooke met the gorilla-man. The close-cropped
nape of his neck between his black hair and the black
collar of his sportsman’s coat, and the knobs that were his
ears—I did not comprehend at first that these were what I
saw. When my amazement and alarm had subsided, and I
realized that Cosgrove was in there—I think I hated him then.
His odious behaviour toward his intended wife and the sinister
hint beneath Bob’s bitter outbreak had rankled. My survey
from outside my window a minute later happened to prove
that no one was in the immediate vicinity of the Hall. Otherwise
I should hardly have felt the sense of satisfaction snug at
the heart of my shivering soul when—after the bracket had
given way—I realized that <em>something had happened</em>! But not
until I reached the lawn did I know that it had happened
to Cosgrove. I shall never be sure in my inmost soul whether
or not I was quite aware that this trivial act might loose some
destructive force—whether I am a murderer or the toy of Fate.</p>

<p>They say, however, that the placards I left and the stone
I cast down from the balcony convince me of malice prepense.
They do not, though they seem to do so.</p>

<p>The placard I left in Cosgrove’s chamber that morning
(the bottom of a cardboard box I found in the store-rooms)
meant no more than what it said: mischief. I never had any
delusion about the supernatural aspect of Parson Lolly;
indeed, the stressing of that element had made me a little
suspicious of Cosgrove himself. Celts do odd things. I believed that
for some clandestine reason he might be behind the manifestations,
and I thought it would be good sport to play his own
game against him. I merely proved to be wrong.</p>

<p>The second placard was a flash of inspiration, after the
bracket had given way and pandemonium burst out below me.
There might be a way of shifting the onus, if anything actually
catastrophic had taken place!—if there <em>had</em> been a cat’s claw,
and—! Parson Lolly again! It did not take twenty seconds
to dash into the storeroom, find the cover of the same box,
scrawl the words, and fling the placard out of the window
for the wind to carry. Later I destroyed every scrap of the box.</p>

<p>The stone I pitched down late that night. It was an
obvious afterthought, and a good one.</p>

<p>As for Heatheringham’s death, it was black misfortune and
nothing else. It appears that on account of Cosgrove’s Will he
looked askance on Paula Lebetwood, but even had he suspected
me, I do not think I could have been so callous as to wipe
him from the earth in a bloody smear. I was doubtful that
minute in my room, which was the more prudent course for
me: to dash the bracket down, creating a new disturbance, or
to leave it untouched. Prudence certainly decided to let the
accursed thing alone, but one moment’s recklessness defied
prudence. I solemnly assert that I believed the Hall was empty
and Heatheringham somewhere in the twilight north of the
House.</p>

<p>Salt, it seems, was a shrewder fellow than his appearance
betokened. He had suspected me from the first night he came
to the House. “The way he looked at Miss Lebetwood, or
rather the way he avoided looking at her, set me thinking”;
such are the words which commence an interview given to one
of the more lurid newspapers. Salt’s homely yet somehow
handsome face, accompanied by well-combed beard, adorns
this report, which concludes with an irony I suppose must be
accidental: “I am glad Mr. Bannerlee didn’t injure my car.”</p>

<p>While irony is fresh in mind, irony was never more dramatic
than in that business of the water-wheel, facts they found when
the claw was dismantled and the channel investigated. That
the Knight’s dead body, blundering down the channel, should
have dislodged the obstruction which otherwise would have
prevented the wheel from turning and the claw from darting
out! So Sir Brooke, elderly and infirm, stumbling to his death,
fulfilled his mission after all.</p>

<p>I have received a message from Lib, and I may as well close
with that. It was transmitted to me through an American
newspaper, by means of a simple “dictionary” cipher code I
explained to her in a farewell letter from that Mediterranean
isle of mine:</p>

<blockquote class="document">

  <p>“Dear Bannerlee Paula’s going to marry a guy named
  Frank Andrews she knew here in the States before she bumped
  into Cosgrove Bobby and I too as soon as Bobby is twenty one
  the first boy will be named after you why not I hope you are
  not too sad in that place wherever you are and I wish you
  could come and see us sometime but I guess you’d better not a
  plain-clothes policeman says good morning to me every day
  when I go round the corner so it wouldn’t be healthy for you
  here I sure wish Paula had met you before this Andrews or
  Cosgrove there would have been nothing to it and everything
  would be rosy Paula is terribly sorry but she doesn’t hate you
  Love Lib.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, some day in the forties, when the Radnorshire riddles
are buried in oblivion beneath the ashes of a hundred other
mysteries—I shall return! I shall visit little Lib, and find it
difficult to recognize in her matronly staidness a trace of the
dash and frankness of her liking for me. Perhaps, too, I shall
pat that “first boy” on the head.</p>

<p>Shall I dare to see <em>her</em>? Or, shall I stand outside her lighted
window, remembering. That would be better, I believe. I can
be nothing to her then, but once—</p>

<p>After all, she did not despise me!</p>
